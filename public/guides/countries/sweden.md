**Key Highlights:**
- Municipal tax averages 32.41% nationally (varies by municipality)
- State tax of 20% applies on income above SEK 625,800
- Employer social contributions: 31.42%
- Expert tax regime: 25% income exemption for foreign specialists
- No employee-paid social contributions
- Tax residency triggered by 6-month stay or substantial ties

## 1. Income Tax Structure

### 1.1 Municipal Tax (Kommunalskatt)

Municipal tax is the primary income tax in Sweden, collected by each municipality (kommun) and region (landsting/region). The rate varies by location.

**National Average (2025):** 32.41%

**Major Cities (2025):**

| City | Total Municipal Tax Rate |
|------|-------------------------|
| Stockholm | 30.60% |
| Gothenburg (Göteborg) | 31.50% |
| Malmö | 31.20% |
| National Average | 32.41% |
| Österåker (lowest) | 28.98% |
| Degerfors (highest) | 35.30% |

**Note:** The "total municipal tax rate" includes both the municipal tax and the regional tax (landstingsskatt) combined. Stockholm has one of the lowest rates in Sweden at 30.60%, while rates can be as high as 35.30% in some municipalities.

### 1.2 State Income Tax (Statlig Skatt)

State income tax is levied by the national government on high earners, in addition to municipal tax.

**Rate:** 20% (flat rate on income above threshold)

**Threshold (2025):** SEK 625,800 per year

**Practical Thresholds (after grundavdrag):**
- Under 66 years old: SEK 643,100 per year (625,800 + 17,300 basic deduction)
- Age 66 and over: SEK 733,200 per year (625,800 + 107,400 basic deduction)

**Marginal Tax Rates:**
- Income below SEK 625,800: ~30-32% (municipal tax only)
- Income above SEK 625,800: ~50-52% (municipal + state tax)

**Note:** From 2025, the highest average marginal tax rate was reduced from 55% to 52%.

### 1.3 Combined Tax Examples

**Example 1: SEK 500,000 annual income (Stockholm resident, under 66)**
- Taxable income: 500,000 - 17,300 = 482,700
- Municipal tax: 482,700 × 30.60% = 147,706
- State tax: 0 (below threshold)
- **Total tax: 147,706 (29.5% effective rate)**

**Example 2: SEK 800,000 annual income (Stockholm resident, under 66)**
- Taxable income: 800,000 - 17,300 = 782,700
- Municipal tax: 782,700 × 30.60% = 239,506
- State tax: (782,700 - 625,800) × 20% = 31,380
- **Total tax: 270,886 (33.9% effective rate)**

---

## 2. Basic Deduction (Grundavdrag)

The grundavdrag is a tax-free allowance that reduces taxable income for all taxpayers.

**Amounts (2025):**
- Under 66 years old: SEK 17,300
- Age 66 and over: SEK 107,400

**How it works:** The grundavdrag is automatically deducted from your gross income before calculating tax. You don't need to apply for it.

---

## 3. Work Tax Credit (Jobbskatteavdrag)

The jobbskatteavdrag is a tax credit (not a deduction) that reduces the final tax liability for people with work income.

**Maximum Amount (2025):** SEK 3,941 per month (approximately SEK 47,300 per year)

**Eligibility:** Applies to earned income from employment or self-employment

**Key Changes in 2025:**
- Phase-out for high earners was abolished (previously applied 2016-2024)
- Credit now fully available regardless of income level
- Amount depends on municipal tax rate (higher municipal tax = larger credit)

**How it works:**
- The credit is calculated as a percentage of your work income
- It's applied after municipal and state taxes are calculated
- The credit effectively reduces your tax rate by several percentage points
- For 2025, provides up to SEK 3,941/month for incomes up to ~SEK 39,600/month

## 4. Social Security Contributions (Arbetsgivaravgifter)

### 4.1 Employer Contributions

Sweden has high employer social security contributions, but employees pay **zero** social contributions directly from their salary.

**Total Employer Rate (2025):** 31.42% of gross salary

**Breakdown:**

| Component | Rate |
|-----------|------|
| Health insurance (Sjukförsäkring) | 3.55% |
| Parental insurance (Föräldraförsäkring) | 2.60% |
| Pension contributions (Ålderspension) | 10.21% |
| Survivor's pension (Efterlevandepension) | 0.60% |
| Labour market contributions (Arbetsmarknadsavgift) | 2.64% |
| Work injury insurance (Arbetsskadeförsäkring) | 0.20% |
| General payroll tax (Allmän löneavgift) | 11.62% |
| **Total** | **31.42%** |

**Age-Based Variations:**
- Born 1959 or later: 31.42% (full rate)
- Born 1938-1958: 10.21% (pension contributions only)
- Born 1937 or earlier: 0% (no contributions)
- From 2026: 67+ years old = 10.21% only

**Additional Payroll Taxes:**
- Special payroll tax on pension costs: 24.26% (applies to certain pension benefits)

### 4.2 Employee Contributions

**Employee social security contributions: 0%**

Swedish employees do not pay social security contributions directly from their salary. All social security funding comes from employer contributions. Employees only pay income tax (municipal + state) through the PAYE system.

**Note:** There is a 7% "general pension contribution" (allmän pensionsavgift) that is technically deducted, but it's included in the calculation of pension-qualifying income (PGI) and is not separately visible on payslips as a deduction.

---

## 5. Expert Tax Regime (Expertskatt)

This is the most important feature for internationally mobile workers. The expert tax regime offers significant tax savings for foreign specialists working in Sweden.

### 5.1 Overview

**Benefit:** 25% of your income is **tax-exempt** for up to 5 years

**Administered by:** Forskarskattenämnden (Taxation of Research Workers Board)

**How it works:**
- You only pay income tax on 75% of your salary
- The employer still pays full social contributions (31.42%)
- Tax savings typically amount to 7-10% of gross salary

**Example:** On SEK 800,000 annual salary with expert tax:
- Normal taxation: ~34% effective rate = SEK 272,000 tax
- With expert tax: Tax calculated on SEK 600,000 only = ~SEK 204,000
- **Tax savings: ~SEK 68,000 per year (8.5% of gross salary)**

## 6. Tax Residency Rules

Understanding tax residency is crucial for determining tax obligations in Sweden.

### 6.1 Unlimited Tax Liability (Tax Resident)

You become a Swedish tax resident (unlimited tax liability) if you meet **any** of these criteria:

1. **Permanent Home:** You have a permanent home (bostad) in Sweden available for year-round use

2. **Six-Month Rule:** You stay in Sweden for **six consecutive months or more**

3. **Substantial Ties (Väsentlig anknytning):** You have strong personal or economic ties to Sweden:
   - Family living in Sweden
   - Home ownership in Sweden
   - Business operations in Sweden
   - Stable source of income from Sweden

**Tax consequences:**
- Tax on **worldwide income** (income from all countries)
- Must file Swedish tax return (deklaration)
- Subject to municipal tax + state tax
- Credit for foreign taxes paid (under tax treaties)

**Sources:**

- [Pebbles - Sweden Tax Residency](https://pebbles.day/tax-residency/sweden)

### 6.2 Limited Tax Liability (Non-Resident)

You are a non-resident (limited tax liability) if you:
- Stay less than 6 months
- Have no permanent home in Sweden
- Have no substantial ties to Sweden

**Tax consequences:**
- Tax only on **Swedish-source income**
- Flat 25% withholding tax on employment income (SINK - särskild inkomstskatt)
- No access to grundavdrag or jobbskatteavdrag
- Simplified tax obligations

**SINK Tax:** Non-residents working in Sweden typically pay 25% flat tax at source on Swedish employment income, without deductions or credits.

### 6.3 The 183-Day Rule (Treaty Exception)

The 183-day rule allows certain non-resident workers to avoid Swedish taxation entirely.

**Requirements (all must be met):**

1. **Physical presence:** Stay in Sweden less than 183 days in any 12-month period
2. **Foreign employer:** Employer is NOT Swedish (no permanent establishment in Sweden)
3. **No economic employer:** Not hired out to a Swedish business (economic employer concept)
4. **Non-resident status:** Not a Swedish tax resident

**Introduced:** 2021 (economic employer concept added)

**Practical application:**
- Commonly used by cross-border consultants
- IT contractors from other Nordic countries
- Short-term project assignments
- Business visitors

**Important:** The economic employer concept means that even if you're paid by a foreign company, if you're effectively working for a Swedish client/business, the 183-day rule may not apply.

## 8. Pension-Qualifying Income (PGI)

Understanding PGI is important for building Swedish pension rights.

**Pension-Qualifying Income (Pensionsgrundande Inkomst - PGI):**
- All work income qualifies for pension rights
- Calculated after 7% general pension contribution deduction
- Builds rights in Swedish public pension system

**Limits (2025):**
- **Maximum PGI:** SEK 604,500 (7.5 income base amounts)
- **Maximum gross income for PGI:** SEK 650,442 (8.07 income base amounts)
- **Minimum threshold:** SEK 24,873 (42.3% of price base amount)

**What qualifies:**
- Employment income
- Self-employment income
- Unemployment benefits (a-kassa)
- Certain replacement incomes

**Important for expats:** PGI accumulates even with expert tax regime. The 25% exemption doesn't reduce pension rights.

## 12. Calculation Examples

### Example 1: Foreign Specialist WITHOUT Expert Tax
**Profile:** Software engineer, Stockholm, under 66, SEK 900,000 gross annual salary

1. Gross salary: SEK 900,000
2. Employer social contributions (31.42%): SEK 282,780 (paid by employer)
3. Basic deduction (grundavdrag): SEK 17,300
4. Taxable income: 900,000 - 17,300 = SEK 882,700
5. Municipal tax (30.60%): 882,700 × 30.60% = SEK 270,106
6. State tax (20% on income > 625,800): (882,700 - 625,800) × 20% = SEK 51,380
7. Total tax before credits: SEK 321,486
8. Work tax credit (jobbskatteavdrag): ~SEK 47,300
9. **Final tax: SEK 274,186**
10. **Net salary: SEK 625,814 (69.5% of gross)**
11. **Effective tax rate: 30.5%**

1. Gross salary: SEK 900,000
2. Employer social contributions: SEK 282,780 (no change)
3. **Taxable income (75% of gross):** 900,000 × 0.75 = SEK 675,000
4. Basic deduction: SEK 17,300
5. Taxable after grundavdrag: 675,000 - 17,300 = SEK 657,700
6. Municipal tax (30.60%): 657,700 × 30.60% = SEK 201,257
7. State tax: (657,700 - 625,800) × 20% = SEK 6,380
8. Total tax before credits: SEK 207,637
9. Work tax credit: ~SEK 47,300
10. **Final tax: SEK 160,337**

12. **Effective tax rate: 17.8%**
13. **Tax savings vs. normal taxation: SEK 113,849 (12.6% of gross salary)**

### Example 3: Median Income Worker (Swedish Resident)
**Profile:** Swedish resident, Gothenburg, under 66, SEK 410,000 gross annual salary

1. Gross salary: SEK 410,000
2. Employer social contributions: SEK 128,822

## 13. Key Considerations for Implementation

### For Calculator Configuration

When implementing Sweden in the universal salary calculator:

1. **Regional Variation Critical:** Must support municipal-level tax rates (290 municipalities)
   - Suggest dropdown with major cities + "Other (specify rate)"
   - Stockholm, Gothenburg, Malmö, Uppsala, Västerås, Örebro, Linköping, Helsingborg

2. **Expert Tax as Primary Variant:**
   - Base config: Standard Swedish taxation
   - Variant 1: "Expert Tax Regime (Expertskatt)" with 25% exemption
   - Variant 2 (future): "Expert Tax Regime 2026" with 30% exemption

3. **Required Inputs:**
   - Gross annual salary (required)
   - Municipality/city (required - impacts tax rate)
   - Age (required - impacts grundavdrag: under 66 vs. 66+)
   - Expert tax eligibility (optional - enables variant)

4. **Key Calculations:**
   - Grundavdrag (age-dependent)
