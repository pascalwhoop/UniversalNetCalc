## Standard Income Tax (IRPF)

**IRPF** (Impuesto sobre la Renta de las Personas Físicas) is Spain's progressive personal income tax.

### National (State) Tax Brackets 2024-2025

| Income Range | Tax Rate |
|--------------|----------|
| €0 - €12,450 | 19% |
| €12,450 - €20,200 | 24% |
| €20,200 - €35,200 | 30% |
| €35,200 - €60,000 | 37% |
| €60,000 - €300,000 | 45% |
| Over €300,000 | 47% |

**Important:** The total IRPF consists of:
- **State portion** (rates above)
- **Autonomous community portion** (varies by region)

The combined rate can reach 45-50% depending on the region.

### Non-Resident Tax Rates

- **EU/EEA citizens:** 19% flat rate
- **Non-EU/EEA:** 24% flat rate
- Non-residents do not benefit from personal allowances or deductions

---

## Beckham Law - Special Expat Regime

Officially called the **Special Tax Regime for Inbound Workers** (Régimen especial para trabajadores desplazados), nicknamed after footballer David Beckham who was one of the first beneficiaries in 2005.

### Key Benefits

1. **24% Flat Tax Rate**
   - On Spanish-sourced income up to €600,000
   - Income above €600,000 taxed at 47%

2. **Foreign Income Exemption**
   - Foreign employment income, dividends, interest, rental income, and capital gains are NOT taxed in Spain
   - **Important exception:** Income from work activities and entrepreneurial activities performed abroad IS taxed in Spain

3. **Wealth Tax Exemption**
   - Foreign assets excluded from Spanish Wealth Tax
   - Only Spanish-located assets are subject to wealth tax

4. **No Form 720 Obligation**
   - No requirement to declare overseas assets (Modelo 720)
   - Significant compliance simplification

5. **Duration**
   - 6 tax years total (year of arrival + 5 subsequent years)

### Eligibility Requirements

To qualify for the Beckham Law, you must meet ALL of these criteria:

1. **No Recent Spanish Tax Residence**
   - Must not have been a Spanish tax resident in the previous 5 years

2. **Work in Spain**
   - Must be relocating to Spain for work purposes
   - Need employment contract with Spanish company OR
   - Assignment from foreign company to work in Spanish branch/subsidiary

3. **Majority of Work in Spain**
   - Must perform at least 85% of work activities in Spain

4. **Application Timing**
   - Must apply within 6 months of either:
     - Starting work in Spain, OR
     - Registering with Spanish Social Security
     - (Whichever comes first)

### Application Process

- **Form:** Modelo 149
- **Submit to:** Agencia Tributaria (Spanish Tax Agency)
- **Deadline:** Within 6 months of starting work/Social Security registration
- **Processing time:** 1-2 months
- **Required documents:**
  - Passport
  - NIE (foreigner identification number)
  - Employment contract
  - Social Security number

**Critical Note:** Missing the 6-month deadline means complete loss of eligibility. There are no exceptions.

### 2023 Expansion for Digital Nomads

As of December 2023, the Beckham Law was expanded to include:
- Remote workers with foreign employment contracts
- Digital nomad visa holders (with conditions)

**Important Caveat:** Eligibility for digital nomads is complex:
- **Employed workers:** May qualify if they meet all standard Beckham Law requirements
- **Self-employed/freelancers:** Generally NOT eligible for Beckham Law
- Digital nomad visa holders cannot typically combine both regimes
- Must choose between Digital Nomad tax regime OR Beckham Law

### Family Members

Since 2023 reforms, family members of Beckham Law beneficiaries can also opt into the regime if they meet requirements.

### Tax Rates Under Beckham Law

**Spanish-sourced income:**
- Up to €600,000: 24% flat rate
- Above €600,000: 47%

**Dividends, interest, capital gains (if Spanish-sourced and over €200,000):**
- 3% tax rate

---

## Social Security Contributions

Spain's Social Security system (Seguridad Social) is mandatory for all workers.

### 2024 Contribution Rates

**Standard rates for employees:**
- Employee contribution: 6.48%
- Employer contribution: 30.57%
- Additional occupational accident rate: ~1.50% (varies by occupation/industry)

**Maximum contribution base:**
- 2024: €4,720.50 per month (€56,646 annually)
- 2025: €4,909.50 per month (€58,914 annually)

### New Solidarity Contribution (Effective January 1, 2025)

For employees whose remuneration exceeds the maximum contribution base, an additional "solidarity contribution" applies in three progressive tiers:

**Tier 1:** Income up to 10% above maximum base
- Total rate: 0.92% in 2025
- Employer: 0.77%
- Employee: 0.15%

**Tier 2:** Income 10% to 50% above maximum base
- Total rate: 1.00% in 2025
- (Split between employer/employee)

**Tier 3:** Income exceeding 50% above maximum base
- Total rate: 1.17% in 2025
- Employer: 0.98%
- Employee: 0.19%

**Note:** These solidarity contribution rates will increase by 0.25% annually until 2045.

### Intergenerational Equity Mechanism (MEI)

- 2025 rate: 0.80%
- 2026 projected: 0.90%
- Employee pays: 0.15%
- Employer pays: 0.75%

### Beckham Law and Social Security

**Important:** Beckham Law beneficiaries are still subject to Spanish Social Security contributions at standard rates. The 24% flat tax does NOT replace Social Security obligations.

---

## Regional Tax Variations

Spain's autonomous communities set their own regional IRPF rates, creating significant tax differences across regions.

### Key Regional Differences (2024-2025)

**Madrid:**
- Most tax-competitive region
- Combined top rate: ~45% (state + regional)
- 100% wealth tax rebate (effectively €0 wealth tax)

**Catalonia:**
- Highest regional tax rates
- Combined top rate: ~50% (state + regional)
- Higher wealth tax rates (up to 2.75-3.75%)
- Lower wealth tax exemption (€500,000 vs €700,000 national)

**General Impact:**
- For high earners (€300,000+), the difference between most and least favorable regions can exceed 9% on top marginal rate
- Regional differences can mean thousands of euros in annual tax differences

### Regional Components

The total IRPF rate consists of:
- **State scale:** Same nationwide (except Basque Country and Navarre)
- **Regional scale:** Set by each autonomous community

**Savings income tax rates** (dividends, capital gains, interest) are the SAME across all regions - no regional variation.

---

## Tax Deductions and Allowances

Spain provides tax allowances through the **Mínimo Personal y Familiar** (personal and family minimum) system.

### Personal Allowances (2024-2025)

**Base taxpayer allowance:**
- Under 65: €5,550 annually
- Age 65-74: +€1,150 (total €6,700)
- Age 75+: +€1,400 additional (total €8,100)

**Disability additions (taxpayer):**
- 33% disability: +€3,000 annually
- 65% disability: +€9,000 annually
- If assistance needed or reduced mobility: +€3,000 additional

### Dependent Descendant Allowances

**Base amounts by birth order:**
- 1st child: €2,400 annually
- 2nd child: €2,700 annually
- 3rd child: €4,000 annually
- 4th+ children: €4,500 annually each

**Additional:**
- Child under 3 years: +€2,800 per year

**Disability additions (descendants):**
- 33% disability: +€3,000 annually
- 65% disability: +€9,000 annually
- If assistance needed or reduced mobility: +€3,000 additional

### Ascendant (Parent) Allowances

**Base amounts:**
- Per parent: €1,150 annually
- Age 75+: +€1,400

**Disability additions (ascendants):**
- 33% disability: +€3,000 annually
- 65% disability: +€9,000 annually
- If assistance needed or reduced mobility: +€3,000 additional

### How Allowances Work

These allowances are **NOT deductions from taxable income**. Instead:
1. Calculate total allowances based on personal/family situation
2. Apply tax rate to allowances to determine reduction
3. Reduction is applied as a **tax credit** against final tax liability

### Other Key Deductions

- **Pension contributions:** Maximum €1,500 per year (as of 2022)
- **Mortgage interest:** Limited for new mortgages (more generous for older loans)
- **Energy efficiency improvements:** Regional variations
- **Regional deductions:** Each autonomous community offers specific deductions

### 2025 Update: SMI Exemption

Workers earning the minimum wage (Salario Mínimo Interprofesional - SMI) are exempt from IRPF in 2025 through a new mechanism.

---

## Tax Residency Rules

Understanding tax residency is critical for determining which tax regime applies.

### The 183-Day Rule

You are considered a **Spanish tax resident** if you meet ANY of these criteria:

1. **Physical presence:** Remain in Spain for more than 183 days during the calendar year
   - Sporadic absences count as days in Spain unless you prove tax residence elsewhere
   - Critical date: **July 2** (183rd day of year)
   - Arriving before July 2 with intent to stay = likely tax resident that year

2. **Economic interests:** Main core or base of economic activities or interests in Spain

3. **Family ties:** Spouse (not legally separated) and minor dependent children habitually reside in Spain
   - Creates presumption of Spanish tax residence

### Tax Residency Certificate

**Certificate of Tax Residence (Certificado de Residencia Fiscal):**
- Issued by: Agencia Tributaria (AEAT)
- Processing time: 2-3 weeks
- Validity: 1 year from issuance
- Application: Online via AEAT platform or in person

**Importance for dual residency:**
- If you have a tax residence certificate from a country with a Double Taxation Agreement (DTA) with Spain, Spanish tax authorities generally cannot override it
- Critical protection against dual residency conflicts

### Non-Resident vs Resident Taxation

**Tax residents:**
- Taxed on worldwide income
- Progressive IRPF rates (19-47%)
- Access to deductions and allowances
- Must file annual tax return (Modelo 100)

**Non-residents:**
- Taxed only on Spanish-sourced income
- Flat rates: 19% (EU/EEA) or 24% (others)
- No personal allowances
- Different filing requirements

---

## Savings and Investment Income

Spain applies separate tax rates to "savings income" (capital gains, dividends, interest).

### Savings Income Tax Rates (2024-2025)

Progressive rates for Spanish tax residents:

| Income Range | Tax Rate |
|--------------|----------|
| €0 - €6,000 | 19% |
| €6,000 - €50,000 | 21% |
| €50,000 - €200,000 | 23% |
| €200,000 - €300,000 | 27% |
| Over €300,000 | 30% |

**Important notes:**
- These rates are **uniform nationwide** - no regional variation
- Top rate increased from 28% to 30% in 2025 for income over €300,000
- Applies to: dividends, interest, capital gains, life insurance income, pension annuities

### Non-Resident Savings Income

- Dividend income: 19% flat rate (may be reduced by tax treaties)
- Capital gains: Generally 19%

### Beckham Law and Savings Income

Under Beckham Law:
- Foreign-sourced savings income: **NOT taxed in Spain**
- Spanish-sourced savings income over €200,000: 3% rate

---

## Wealth Tax

### National Wealth Tax (Regional)

**Standard exemption thresholds:**
- General exemption: €700,000 per person

- Foreign assets: **Exempt from Spanish wealth tax**
- Spanish assets: Subject to wealth tax (with regional rules)
- Significant benefit for high-net-worth individuals

## Implementation Notes for Calculator

### Base Configuration (Standard IRPF)

**Inputs required:**
- Gross annual salary
- Filing status (not relevant for Spain - tax is individual)
- Autonomous community (region)
- Age
- Number of dependent children (by age)
- Number of dependent ascendants
- Disability status (taxpayer and dependents)

**Calculation flow:**
1. Calculate taxable income (gross salary)
2. Apply state tax brackets (progressive)
3. Apply regional tax brackets (progressive, varies by community)
4. Calculate savings income tax separately (if applicable)
5. Calculate personal and family allowances
6. Convert allowances to tax credits
7. Subtract credits from total tax
8. Calculate Social Security contributions (6.48% up to max base)
9. Add solidarity contribution if income exceeds max base
10. Calculate net income

**Categories for breakdown:**
- State income tax (IRPF - state)
- Regional income tax (IRPF - regional)
- Social Security contributions (employee)
- Solidarity contribution (if applicable)
- Tax credits (negative - reduces tax)

### Beckham Law Variant

**Inputs required:**
- Gross annual salary (Spanish-sourced only)
- Year of regime (1-6)

**Calculation flow:**
1. Calculate Spanish-sourced income
2. Apply flat 24% rate up to €600,000
3. Apply 47% rate to income above €600,000
4. Calculate Social Security contributions (same as standard)
5. Add solidarity contribution if applicable
6. No personal/family allowances
7. No regional variation
8. Calculate net income

**Simplified breakdown:**
- Beckham flat tax (24% or 47%)

- High income (€100,000) - upper middle class
- Very high income (€200,000) - high earner
- Above Social Security max (€70,000) - solidarity contribution applies

**Regional variations:**
- Same income levels tested in Madrid vs Catalonia

**Beckham Law:**
- €50,000 (clearly under €600k threshold)
- €600,000 (at threshold)
- €800,000 (mixed rate - partly 24%, partly 47%)

**Family situations:**
- Single, no children
- With 2 children (one under 3)

## Key Takeaways for Config Implementation

### Critical Features

1. **Beckham Law is highly relevant** - Must be implemented as a variant
2. **Regional variations are significant** - At minimum, implement Madrid and Catalonia
3. **Social Security has complexity** - Max base, solidarity contribution above max
4. **Allowances work differently** - Not deductions from income, but tax credits
5. **Two separate tax bases** - General income (progressive) vs savings income (separate progressive)

### Challenges

1. **Regional data** - Need accurate regional tax scale for each autonomous community
2. **Beckham Law limitations** - Foreign income exclusions and special rules
3. **Social Security tiers** - Multiple contribution rates based on income levels
4. **Family situation complexity** - Many dependent variables affect allowances
5. **Wealth tax** - Separate from income tax but relevant for high earners

### Data Needed

1. Complete regional tax scales for major autonomous communities (2024-2025)
2. Official Social Security contribution rates and maximum bases
3. Official IRPF state tax scales (confirmed from Agencia Tributaria)
4. Solidarity contribution tier thresholds and rates
5. Exact thresholds for personal/family allowances

### Recommended Variants

1. **Base:** Standard IRPF (choose one region as default, e.g., Madrid)
2. **Variant 1:** Beckham Law
3. **Variant 2:** Catalonia (different regional rates)
4. **Variant 3:** High earner with wealth tax considerations

---

## Next Steps

1. Verify all tax brackets with official Agencia Tributaria sources
2. Obtain complete regional tax scales for Madrid and Catalonia
3. Create detailed test vectors covering edge cases
4. Implement base configuration for Madrid
5. Implement Beckham Law variant
6. Validate calculations against official calculators
7. Add Catalonia regional variant
8. Document all assumptions and data sources
