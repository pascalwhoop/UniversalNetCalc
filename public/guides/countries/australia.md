## 1. Income Tax Structure

### 1.1 Tax Brackets for Residents (2024-25 and 2025-26)

Following the implementation of the revised Stage 3 tax cuts on 1 July 2024, Australian residents face the following tax brackets:

| Taxable Income | Tax Rate | Tax on This Income |
|----------------|----------|-------------------|
| $0 - $18,200 | 0% | Nil (tax-free threshold) |
| $18,201 - $45,000 | 16% | 16c for each $1 over $18,200 |
| $45,001 - $135,000 | 30% | $4,288 plus 30c for each $1 over $45,000 |
| $135,001 - $190,000 | 37% | $31,288 plus 37c for each $1 over $135,000 |
| $190,001 and above | 45% | $51,638 plus 45c for each $1 over $190,000 |

**Note:** These rates do not include the 2% Medicare levy, which is calculated separately.

### 1.2 Stage 3 Tax Cuts Implementation

The Stage 3 tax cuts were implemented from 1 July 2024 with the following changes:
- Reduced the lowest tax bracket rate from 19% to 16%
- Merged the 32.5% and 37% brackets into a single 30% bracket up to $135,000
- Raised the 37% threshold from $120,000 to $135,000
- Raised the 45% threshold from $180,000 to $190,000

**Result:** Every Australian taxpayer receives a tax cut, with the benefit varying by income level.

### 1.3 Future Tax Changes (2026 and 2027)

Additional tax relief is scheduled:
- **From 1 July 2026:** The 16% rate reduces to 15%
- **From 1 July 2027:** The 15% rate further reduces to 14%

These changes will continue to provide relief from "bracket creep" (the effect of inflation pushing taxpayers into higher tax brackets).

### 1.4 Non-Resident Tax Rates (2024-25 and 2025-26)

Foreign residents (non-residents) are taxed only on Australian-sourced income and do not receive the tax-free threshold:

| Taxable Income | Tax Rate | Tax on This Income |
|----------------|----------|-------------------|
| $0 - $135,000 | 30% | 30c for each $1 |
| $135,001 - $190,000 | 37% | $40,500 plus 37c for each $1 over $135,000 |
| $190,001 and above | 45% | $60,850 plus 45c for each $1 over $190,000 |

**Important:**
- Non-residents pay tax from the first dollar earned (no tax-free threshold)
- Non-residents do NOT pay the Medicare levy
- Example: A non-resident earning $18,200 pays $5,460 in tax, while a resident pays nothing due to the tax-free threshold

### 1.5 Working Holiday Maker Tax Rates (2024-25)

Working holiday makers on subclass 417 or 462 visas have special tax rates:

| Taxable Income | Tax Rate | Tax on This Income |
|----------------|----------|-------------------|
| $0 - $45,000 | 15% | 15c for each $1 |
| $45,001 - $135,000 | 32.5% | $6,750 plus 32.5c for each $1 over $45,000 |
| $135,001 - $190,000 | 37% | $36,000 plus 37c for each $1 over $135,000 |
| $190,001 and above | 45% | $56,350 plus 45c for each $1 over $190,000 |

**Key Points:**
- No tax-free threshold applies
- Flat 15% rate on first $45,000 (registered employers can withhold at this rate)
- If no Tax File Number (TFN) is provided, employers must withhold at 45%
- WHMs earning under $45,001 with correct withholding are not required to lodge a tax return (but may choose to if claiming deductions)

---

## 2. Medicare Levy

### 2.1 Standard Medicare Levy

**Rate:** 2% of taxable income

The Medicare levy is payable by most Australian resident taxpayers in addition to income tax. It helps fund Australia's public healthcare system (Medicare).

**Calculation:** Medicare levy = Taxable income × 2%

### 2.2 Medicare Levy Surcharge (MLS)

The Medicare Levy Surcharge is an additional tax for Australian residents who earn above certain thresholds and do not have appropriate private patient hospital cover.

#### 2.2.1 MLS Income Thresholds and Rates (2024-25)

| Tier | Singles | Families | Rate |
|------|---------|----------|------|
| Base (No Surcharge) | Up to $97,000 | Up to $194,000 | 0% |
| Tier 1 | $97,001 - $113,000 | $194,001 - $226,000 | 1.0% |
| Tier 2 | $113,001 - $151,000 | $226,001 - $302,000 | 1.25% |
| Tier 3 | $151,001 and above | $302,001 and above | 1.5% |

**Family Threshold Adjustment:** The family income threshold increases by $1,500 for each dependent child after the first.

**Important:** The MLS is separate from and additional to the standard 2% Medicare levy.

### 2.3 Medicare Levy Exemptions

#### Full Exemption Categories:
- Foreign residents for tax purposes (for the full or partial year they are non-resident)
- Temporary residents who hold a Medicare Entitlement Statement (MES) showing they were not entitled to Medicare benefits
- Low-income earners below certain thresholds
- Certain visa holders and foreign government representatives

#### Temporary Residents:
To claim the exemption as a temporary resident, you must:
1. Hold a Medicare Entitlement Statement (MES) showing you were not entitled to Medicare benefits
2. All dependants (including spouse) must also be in a Medicare levy exemption category

**Limitation:** You cannot claim the exemption if your spouse was entitled to Medicare benefits, even if you hold a valid MES.

#### Partial Year Exemptions:
If your residency status or visa changes during the year, you can claim a partial exemption by specifying the number of exempt days on your tax return. The ATO calculates the levy pro-rata.

### 2.4 Medicare Levy Reduction for Low-Income Earners

Low-income earners may receive a reduction in the Medicare levy. Thresholds are indexed annually and vary for singles, families, and seniors.

---

## 3. Superannuation (Mandatory Retirement Savings)

### 3.1 Superannuation Guarantee (SG) Rate

Australia has a mandatory employer-funded retirement savings system called superannuation.

**Current Rate (2024-25):** 11.5% of ordinary time earnings (OTE)

**Future Rate (from 1 July 2025):** 12% of ordinary time earnings (OTE)

This represents the completion of the legislated SG rate increases.

### 3.2 How Superannuation Works

- **Employers must contribute** a minimum percentage of each eligible employee's ordinary time earnings to their superannuation fund
- Contributions must be paid at least **quarterly**
- Employees choose their own superannuation fund (or use employer's default fund)
- Superannuation is generally preserved until retirement age (currently ranging from 60-67 depending on birth year)
- Superannuation is taxed at concessional rates (15% on contributions and earnings, 0% on withdrawals after 60 in most cases)

### 3.3 Ordinary Time Earnings (OTE)

OTE includes:
- Salary and wages
- Commissions
- Shift loadings
- Bonuses
- Allowances
- Over-award payments

OTE excludes:
- Overtime payments
- Reimbursement of expenses

### 3.4 Maximum Contribution Base (2024-25)

**Quarterly maximum:** $65,070 (increased from $62,270 in 2023-24)

**Annual maximum:** $260,280

Once an employee earns above this quarterly amount, employers are not required to pay SG on the excess amount.

### 3.5 Employee Eligibility

Employers must pay superannuation for employees who are:
- **18 years or older** (regardless of hours worked or income earned)
- **Under 18 years old** but work more than 30 hours per week

**Key Changes:**
- The $450 monthly earnings threshold was removed from 1 July 2022 (all employees now receive super if they meet age requirements)
- The upper age limit for SG contributions was removed (employers must pay super regardless of employee age)

### 3.6 Exemptions from Superannuation Guarantee

Employers are not required to pay SG for:
- Employees under 18 working 30 hours or less per week
- Employees paid less than $450 per month (removed from 1 July 2022, now all earnings count)
- Some foreign executives on certain visas or entry permits
- Resident employees paid by non-resident employers for work done outside Australia
- Employees doing domestic or private work for 30 hours or less per week (e.g., nannies, housekeepers)
- Employees paid under a Working Holiday Maker visa in some circumstances

### 3.7 Superannuation for Casual and Part-Time Workers

Casual and part-time employees are entitled to superannuation on the same basis as full-time employees, provided they meet the age requirements. The removal of the $450 monthly threshold means even very low-earning casual workers receive superannuation.

---

## 4. Tax Offsets (Credits)

### 4.1 Low Income Tax Offset (LITO)

The Low Income Tax Offset reduces the amount of tax payable for lower-income Australian residents.

**Maximum Offset:** $700

#### LITO Calculation (2024-25):

| Taxable Income | LITO Amount |
|----------------|-------------|
| $0 - $37,500 | $700 (maximum) |
| $37,501 - $45,000 | $700 minus 5c for each $1 over $37,500 |
| $45,001 - $66,667 | $325 minus 1.5c for each $1 over $45,000 |
| $66,668 and above | Nil |

**How to Claim:** LITO is automatically calculated by the ATO when you lodge your tax return. No separate application is required.

**Example Calculations:**

1. **Income: $35,000**
   - LITO = $700 (full offset)

2. **Income: $40,000**
   - LITO = $700 - (($40,000 - $37,500) × 0.05)
   - LITO = $700 - $125 = $575

3. **Income: $50,000**
   - First phase-out complete at $45,000: $700 - (($45,000 - $37,500) × 0.05) = $325
   - Second phase-out: $325 - (($50,000 - $45,000) × 0.015)
   - LITO = $325 - $75 = $250

4. **Income: $70,000**
   - LITO = Nil (income exceeds threshold)

### 4.2 Low and Middle Income Tax Offset (LMITO) - DISCONTINUED

**Status:** LMITO was discontinued after the 2021-22 financial year.

The Low and Middle Income Tax Offset provided up to $1,080 (with an additional $420 cost-of-living payment in 2021-22) for taxpayers earning up to $126,000. This offset is no longer available from 2022-23 onwards.

**Impact:** Many taxpayers saw smaller refunds from 2022-23 onwards when LMITO ended. The Stage 3 tax cuts partially compensate for this reduction.

### 4.3 Other Tax Offsets

Other offsets may be available to specific taxpayers:
- Senior Australians and Pensioners Tax Offset (SAPTO)
- Zone Tax Offset (for residents of remote areas)
- Private Health Insurance Rebate
- Spouse Tax Offset (in certain limited circumstances)

---

## 5. Tax Residency Rules

### 5.1 Determining Tax Residency

Australia uses a combination of tests to determine tax residency:

1. **Resides Test:** Do you reside in Australia according to ordinary meaning?
2. **Domicile Test:** Is Australia your domicile and are you not a permanent resident elsewhere?
3. **183-Day Test:** Are you present in Australia for more than half the income year (183 days)?
4. **Superannuation Test:** Are you a Commonwealth employee with eligible superannuation?

If you satisfy any of these tests, you are generally an Australian resident for tax purposes.

### 5.2 Temporary Residents

A **temporary resident** for tax purposes is broadly defined as someone who:
- Holds a temporary visa under the Migration Act 1958
- Is not an Australian resident within the meaning of the Social Security Act 1991
- Does not have an Australian spouse (who is an Australian citizen, permanent resident, or New Zealand citizen)

Common temporary visas include:
- Skilled work visas (subclass 482, 494)
- Student visas (subclass 500)
- Partner visas (subclass 820, 309 while temporary)
- Graduate visas (subclass 485)

### 5.3 Tax Treatment of Temporary Residents

Temporary residents enjoy special tax treatment under Section 768-R of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997:

#### What Temporary Residents Must Pay Tax On:
- All Australian-sourced employment income
- Australian-sourced investment income (interest, dividends, rent from Australian property)
- Capital gains on taxable Australian property

#### What Temporary Residents Do NOT Pay Tax On:
- Foreign-sourced employment income (in most cases)
- Foreign-sourced passive investment income (interest, dividends, capital gains from foreign assets)
- Capital gains on non-Australian assets

**Example:** A temporary resident working in Australia on a 482 visa:
- Pays full Australian tax on their Australian salary
- Does NOT pay Australian tax on rental income from property they own in their home country
- Does NOT pay Australian tax on dividends from shares in foreign companies
- Cannot offset foreign losses against Australian income

### 5.4 When Temporary Resident Status Ends

Temporary resident tax status ends when:
- You become a permanent resident
- You acquire an Australian citizen or permanent resident spouse
- Your temporary visa expires and you leave Australia

Once temporary resident status ends, you become a regular Australian resident for tax purposes and must declare worldwide income.

---

## 6. Special Regimes for International Workers

### 6.1 Working Holiday Makers (Backpackers)

See Section 1.5 for tax rates.

**Additional Requirements:**
- Must register with the ATO as a working holiday maker
- Must provide Tax File Number to employer to avoid 45% withholding
- Subject to different tax rates than regular residents or non-residents
- Generally cannot claim the tax-free threshold

### 6.2 Foreign Executives and Specialists

Certain foreign executives may be exempt from superannuation if they:
- Hold specific visas (generally executive or specialist visas)
- Have appropriate entry permits
- Work in certain capacities

These workers may also be eligible for treaty benefits under Australia's tax treaties.

---

## 7. Calculation Examples

### 7.1 Example 1: Australian Resident - Single, No Dependents

**Gross Income:** $80,000
**Filing Status:** Single resident taxpayer

**Income Tax Calculation:**
- $0 - $18,200: $0
- $18,201 - $45,000: ($45,000 - $18,200) × 16% = $4,288
- $45,001 - $80,000: ($80,000 - $45,000) × 30% = $10,500
- **Total Income Tax:** $14,788

**LITO Calculation:**
- Income exceeds $66,667, so LITO = $0

**Medicare Levy:**
- $80,000 × 2% = $1,600

**Medicare Levy Surcharge:**
- Income under $97,000 threshold, so MLS = $0 (assuming no private health insurance)

**Total Tax Payable:** $14,788 + $1,600 = $16,388
**Effective Tax Rate:** 20.49%
**Net Income:** $80,000 - $16,388 = $63,612

**Superannuation (not deducted from net):**
- Employer contributes 11.5% × $80,000 = $9,200 (2024-25)
- Or 12% × $80,000 = $9,600 (from 1 July 2025)

### 7.2 Example 2: Australian Resident - Low Income

**Gross Income:** $40,000
**Filing Status:** Single resident taxpayer

**Income Tax Calculation:**
- $0 - $18,200: $0
- $18,201 - $40,000: ($40,000 - $18,200) × 16% = $3,488
- **Total Income Tax:** $3,488

**LITO Calculation:**
- Income between $37,501 and $45,000
- LITO = $700 - (($40,000 - $37,500) × 0.05)
- LITO = $700 - $125 = $575

**Medicare Levy:**
- $40,000 × 2% = $800

**Total Tax Before Offset:** $3,488 + $800 = $4,288
**Less LITO:** -$575
**Total Tax Payable:** $3,713
**Effective Tax Rate:** 9.28%
**Net Income:** $40,000 - $3,713 = $36,287

**Superannuation:**
- Employer contributes 11.5% × $40,000 = $4,600 (2024-25)

### 7.3 Example 3: Non-Resident

**Gross Income:** $80,000 (Australian-sourced)
**Filing Status:** Foreign resident (non-resident)

**Income Tax Calculation:**
- $0 - $80,000: $80,000 × 30% = $24,000
- **Total Income Tax:** $24,000

**Medicare Levy:** $0 (non-residents don't pay)
**LITO:** $0 (not available to non-residents)

**Total Tax Payable:** $24,000
**Effective Tax Rate:** 30.00%
**Net Income:** $80,000 - $24,000 = $56,000

**Superannuation:**
- If employed in Australia, employer must contribute 11.5% × $80,000 = $9,200

### 7.4 Example 4: Temporary Resident

**Gross Income:** $100,000 (Australian salary)
**Foreign Income:** $20,000 (rental income from home country)
**Filing Status:** Temporary resident (e.g., 482 visa)

**Income Tax Calculation (Australian income only):**
- $0 - $18,200: $0
- $18,201 - $45,000: ($45,000 - $18,200) × 16% = $4,288
- $45,001 - $100,000: ($100,000 - $45,000) × 30% = $16,500
- **Total Income Tax:** $20,788

**LITO:** $0 (income exceeds threshold)

**Medicare Levy:**
- Option 1: Exempt (if holding MES and not entitled to Medicare benefits): $0
- Option 2: Not exempt: $100,000 × 2% = $2,000

**Assuming Medicare Levy Exemption:**
**Total Tax Payable:** $20,788
**Effective Tax Rate:** 20.79% (on Australian income only)
**Net Income (Australian):** $100,000 - $20,788 = $79,212

**Foreign Income:** $20,000 NOT taxable in Australia (temporary resident exemption)

**Superannuation:**
- Employer contributes 11.5% × $100,000 = $11,500

### 7.5 Example 5: Working Holiday Maker

**Gross Income:** $35,000
**Filing Status:** Working holiday maker (417 or 462 visa)

**Income Tax Calculation:**
- $0 - $35,000: $35,000 × 15% = $5,250
- **Total Income Tax:** $5,250

**Medicare Levy:** $0 (WHMs don't pay Medicare levy)
**LITO:** $0 (not available to WHMs)

**Total Tax Payable:** $5,250
**Effective Tax Rate:** 15.00%
**Net Income:** $35,000 - $5,250 = $29,750

**Superannuation:**
- Generally entitled to employer contributions: 11.5% × $35,000 = $4,025
- WHMs can claim back their super when leaving Australia permanently (subject to 65% departure tax)

### 7.6 Example 6: High-Income Resident with MLS

**Gross Income:** $200,000
**Filing Status:** Single resident, no private health insurance

**Income Tax Calculation:**
- $0 - $18,200: $0
- $18,201 - $45,000: $4,288
- $45,001 - $135,000: ($135,000 - $45,000) × 30% = $27,000
- $135,001 - $190,000: ($190,000 - $135,000) × 37% = $20,350
- $190,001 - $200,000: ($200,000 - $190,000) × 45% = $4,500
- **Total Income Tax:** $56,138

**LITO:** $0

**Medicare Levy:**
- $200,000 × 2% = $4,000

**Medicare Levy Surcharge (Tier 3):**
- Income exceeds $151,000 for singles
- $200,000 × 1.5% = $3,000

**Total Tax Payable:** $56,138 + $4,000 + $3,000 = $63,138
**Effective Tax Rate:** 31.57%
**Net Income:** $200,000 - $63,138 = $136,862

**Note:** If this taxpayer had appropriate private health insurance, they could avoid the $3,000 MLS.

## 8. Important Notes for Tax Configuration

### 8.1 Tax Calculation Order

1. Calculate taxable income (gross income minus deductions)
2. Apply progressive income tax rates to calculate base tax
3. Apply Low Income Tax Offset (LITO) if eligible
4. Calculate Medicare Levy (2% of taxable income)
5. Calculate Medicare Levy Surcharge if applicable
6. Sum all components for total tax payable

### 8.2 Rounding

The ATO generally rounds amounts to the nearest dollar. Cents are dropped if less than 50 cents, or rounded up if 50 cents or more.

### 8.3 Pay As You Go (PAYG) Withholding

Employers withhold tax from each pay using ATO tax tables. These amounts are credits against the final tax liability when the annual tax return is lodged.

### 8.4 Tax Return Due Date

- Individuals: 31 October following the end of the financial year
- Through registered tax agent: Extended deadlines (typically March-May)

### 8.5 Superannuation Payment Timing

Employers must pay super at least quarterly:
- Q1 (July-Sept): Due 28 October
- Q2 (Oct-Dec): Due 28 January
- Q3 (Jan-Mar): Due 28 April
- Q4 (Apr-Jun): Due 28 July

Late payment attracts the Superannuation Guarantee Charge (SGC), which includes:
- Unpaid super contributions
- Interest (currently 10% p.a.)
- Administration fee ($20 per employee per quarter)
- SGC is NOT tax deductible (unlike regular SG contributions)

## 10. Key Considerations for Universal Net Calculator Implementation

### 10.1 Input Requirements

**Mandatory Inputs:**
- Gross annual income
- Tax residency status (Resident, Non-Resident, Temporary Resident, Working Holiday Maker)
- Filing status (Single, Family - for Medicare Levy Surcharge purposes)

**Optional Inputs:**
- Private health insurance status (for MLS calculation)
- Number of dependents (for family MLS threshold)

4. **Medicare Levy** (2% with exemptions)
5. **Medicare Levy Surcharge** (tiered based on income and insurance status)
6. **Net Income** (gross minus all taxes)
7. **Superannuation** (employer contribution - informational, not deducted from net)

### 10.3 Variants to Consider

- **Base:** Australian resident taxpayer
- **Non-Resident:** Foreign resident rates, no tax-free threshold, no Medicare levy
