## Tax Residency Rules

Tax obligations in Canada depend on **residency status**, not citizenship or immigration status.

### Factual Residents

**Definition:** Individuals who establish **significant residential ties** with Canada.

**Significant Residential Ties Include:**
- Home in Canada (owned or rented)
- Spouse or common-law partner in Canada
- Dependants in Canada

**Secondary Ties Include:**
- Personal property (furniture, cars)
- Social ties (memberships, clubs)
- Economic ties (bank accounts, credit cards, RRSP)
- Canadian driver's licence
- Canadian health insurance

**Tax Obligations:**
- Taxed on **worldwide income** from the date residential ties are established
- Entitled to claim full tax credits and deductions
- File by April 30 of following year

### Deemed Residents (183-Day Rule)

**Definition:** Individuals who:
- Sojourned in Canada for **183 days or more** in a tax year, AND
- Do NOT have significant residential ties to Canada, AND
- Are NOT considered a resident of another country under a tax treaty

**Tax Obligations:**
- Taxed on **worldwide income** for the entire year
- Subject to federal tax + federal surtax (instead of provincial tax)
- Cannot claim certain provincial credits

**Important:** Tax treaties can override the 183-day rule. If a tax treaty deems you a resident of another country, you won't be a deemed resident of Canada even if present 183+ days.

### Non-Residents

**Definition:** Individuals who:
- Do NOT have significant residential ties to Canada
- Stay in Canada fewer than 183 days
- Are not deemed residents

**Tax Obligations:**

## Expat Considerations

### Newcomers to Canada

**When You Become a Tax Resident:**
- Usually the day you establish significant residential ties (typically arrival day)
- Must report worldwide income from that date forward

**First Tax Return:**
- File by April 30 of year following arrival
- Report income earned in Canada plus worldwide income after becoming resident
- Can claim tax credits prorated to time as resident

**Work Permit Holders:**
- A work permit alone doesn't determine tax residency
- Assessed based on residential ties and facts
- Many work permit holders become factual residents if they establish a home and stay long-term

**Permanent Residents:**
- Generally considered tax residents upon landing
- Same tax treatment as Canadian citizens

### Tax Treaties

Canada has tax treaties with 90+ countries that:
- Prevent double taxation
- Define "tie-breaker" rules when dual residency exists
- May reduce withholding tax rates
- Can exempt certain employment income (183-day rule exceptions)

**Common Treaty Provisions:**
- Employment income exempt if present < 183 days AND paid by foreign employer AND no permanent establishment in Canada
- Pension income typically taxable in residence country
- Business profits taxable where permanent establishment exists

### Provincial Residency

- Provincial tax applies based on province of residence on **December 31**
- If you move between provinces during the year, you pay tax to the province where you live on December 31
- Some provinces have special rules for part-year residents

### Quebec Considerations

- Quebec residents must file **two separate tax returns**: federal (CRA) and provincial (Revenu Québec)
- Uses QPP instead of CPP (higher rates)
- Has its own parental insurance plan (QPIP) - reduces EI premiums but adds QPIP premiums
- Federal tax includes 16.5% Quebec abatement

### Tax on Split Income (TOSI)

**Relevance to Expats:** Family business owners and professionals need to be aware.

**Overview:**
- Applies to minors (under 18) and adults receiving income from related businesses
- Income taxed at **top marginal rate (33%)** regardless of actual income
- Cannot claim basic personal amount or other credits on split income
- Applies to dividends, interest, and capital gains from private corporations (not salaries)

**Exclusions for Adults:**
- Excluded business exemption: worked 20+ hours/week in business
- Excluded shares exemption: 25+, owns 10%+ of non-professional corp
- Reasonable return exemption: 25+, income proportional to contribution

### Provincial Tax on Income Below Federal Threshold

Some provinces tax income even when it's below the federal BPA:
- Nova Scotia BPA: $8,744 (vs federal $16,129)
- Newfoundland & Labrador BPA: $11,067

This means you can owe provincial tax even if you owe no federal tax.

## Implementation Notes

### For Universal Net Calculator Config

**Required Inputs:**
- `gross_annual`: Annual gross employment income
- `province`: Province/territory of residence (determines provincial tax)
- `filing_status`: Not relevant for Canada (no married vs single brackets like US)
- `age`: Needed for age credit (65+)

**Optional Inputs:**
- `rrsp_contributions`: Deductible contributions
- `cpp_exempt`: Boolean, for certain employment situations
- `ei_exempt`: Boolean, self-employed can opt out in some cases
- `first_time_homebuyer`: Boolean, for $1,500 credit
- `disability`: Boolean, for disability credit

**Calculation Flow:**
1. Calculate gross income
2. Subtract RRSP deductions
3. Calculate taxable income
4. Apply federal bracket_tax (progressive)
5. Apply provincial bracket_tax (progressive)
6. Apply Ontario surtax (if applicable)
7. Add Ontario Health Premium (if applicable)
8. Calculate CPP/QPP contributions (bracket-like, with exemption and ceiling)
9. Calculate EI premiums (flat rate up to ceiling)
10. Calculate federal non-refundable credits (BPA, Canada Employment Amount, etc.)
11. Calculate provincial non-refundable credits
12. Net = Gross - Federal Tax - Provincial Tax - CPP/QPP - EI - Health Premium + Credits

**Key Considerations:**
- **Quebec special handling**: Separate return, QPP instead of CPP, federal abatement
- **Ontario surtax**: Calculated on provincial tax amount, not income
- **Ontario Health Premium**: Separate calculation, not a tax
- **CPP2 and QPP2**: Two-tier contribution system (base + additional)
- **Provincial variations**: Each province needs separate config or variant
- **Tax treaty complexity**: May need variant for non-residents/deemed residents

**Node Types Needed:**
- `bracket_tax`: For federal and provincial progressive taxes
- `percent_of`: For CPP/EI calculations
- `min`/`max`: For contribution ceilings
- `sub`: For basic exemptions (CPP $3,500)
- `conditional` or `switch`: For province-specific logic
- `sum`: For total tax, total deductions
- `credit`: For non-refundable credits with phaseouts
- Custom `ontario_surtax` function: 20% on tax > $5,818, +36% on tax > $7,446
- Custom `ontario_health_premium` function: Complex bracket system

**Variants to Consider:**
- **quebec**: QPP, federal abatement, separate provincial system
- **deemed-resident**: Federal tax + federal surtax instead of provincial
- **non-resident**: Only Canadian-source income, withholding taxes

## Next Steps for Implementation

1. **Create base config** (`configs/ca/2025/base.yaml`) with federal tax, CPP, EI, basic credits
2. **Create provincial variants:**
   - `on.yaml` - Ontario (with surtax and health premium)
   - `bc.yaml` - British Columbia
   - `qc.yaml` - Quebec (QPP, federal abatement)
   - `ab.yaml` - Alberta
3. **Create deemed-resident variant** for 183-day rule cases (federal + federal surtax)
4. **Create test vectors** for each province at low ($30k), median ($60k), and high ($150k+) incomes
5. **Validate with official calculators:**
   - [EY Tax Calculator](https://www.eytaxcalculators.com/en/2025-personal-tax-calculator.html)
   - Provincial tax calculators (TurboTax, H&R Block)
6. **Document notices** for:
   - Ontario Health Premium bracket creep
   - Quebec separate filing requirement
   - Tax treaty considerations for newcomers
   - RRSP contribution room carry-forward
