## 1. Income Tax Structure

### 1.1 National Income Tax Brackets

South Korea uses progressive tax brackets applicable from January 1, 2023 onwards:

| Annual Taxable Income (KRW) | Marginal Rate | Tax on Lower Bracket (KRW) |
|------------------------------|---------------|----------------------------|
| 0 to 14,000,000 | 6% | 0 |
| 14,000,001 to 50,000,000 | 15% | 840,000 |
| 50,000,001 to 88,000,000 | 24% | 6,240,000 |
| 88,000,001 to 150,000,000 | 35% | 15,360,000 |
| 150,000,001 to 300,000,000 | 38% | 37,060,000 |
| 300,000,001 to 500,000,000 | 40% | 94,060,000 |
| 500,000,001 to 1,000,000,000 | 42% | 174,060,000 |
| Over 1,000,000,000 | 45% | 384,060,000 |

### 1.2 Local Income Tax

A **local income tax of 10%** of the national income tax is assessed on all brackets. This means:

- Effective combined rates range from **6.6% to 49.5%** (including local tax)
- Local tax is calculated as: `Local Tax = National Income Tax × 10%`
- Example: If national income tax is 10,000,000 KRW, local tax is 1,000,000 KRW

### 1.3 Tax Residency Rules

**Resident Classification:**
- Individuals who stay in Korea for **183 days or more** within a tax year are classified as **tax residents**
- Tax residents must report worldwide income
- Non-residents (less than 183 days) only report Korean-sourced income

**Foreign-Source Income Treatment:**
- Residents with **less than 5 years** Korean residence during the preceding decade: Foreign-source income taxed only if paid by Korean entity or transferred to Korea
- Residents with **more than 5 years** residence: All foreign-source income included in global taxation at greater of standard rates or 15.4%

---

## 2. Earned Income Deduction

### 2.1 Deduction Formula

The earned income deduction applies to salary/wage earners, with a **maximum deduction of KRW 20,000,000**:

| Gross Income (KRW) | Base Deduction (KRW) | Marginal Rate on Excess |
|--------------------|----------------------|-------------------------|
| 0 to 5,000,000 | 0 | 70% |
| 5,000,001 to 15,000,000 | 3,500,000 | 40% |
| 15,000,001 to 45,000,000 | 7,500,000 | 15% |
| 45,000,001 to 100,000,000 | 12,000,000 | 5% |
| Over 100,000,000 | 14,750,000 | 2% |

### 2.2 Calculation Examples

**Example 1: Gross income of KRW 30,000,000**
- Base: KRW 7,500,000 (for first 15M)
- Additional: (30M - 15M) × 15% = KRW 2,250,000
- Total deduction: KRW 9,750,000

**Example 2: Gross income of KRW 80,000,000**
- Base: KRW 12,000,000 (for first 45M)
- Additional: (80M - 45M) × 5% = KRW 1,750,000
- Total deduction: KRW 13,750,000

**Example 3: Gross income of KRW 150,000,000**
- Base: KRW 14,750,000 (for first 100M)
- Additional: (150M - 100M) × 2% = KRW 1,000,000
- Subtotal: KRW 15,750,000
- **Capped at maximum:** KRW 20,000,000

### 2.3 Key Points

- Deduction applies to both residents and non-residents
- Calculation based on **total annual income**, not monthly
- Amount exceeding KRW 20 million is not deductible (effective from January 1, 2020)
- Both residents and non-residents are entitled to this deduction

---

## 3. Personal Deductions (Basic Deduction)

### 3.1 Standard Personal Deductions

These deductions reduce taxable income:

| Category | Annual Deduction (KRW) | Eligibility Criteria |
|----------|------------------------|----------------------|
| Taxpayer (self) | 1,500,000 | Automatic |
| Spouse | 1,500,000 | Lives with taxpayer, adjusted gross income < 1,000,000 KRW |
| Each dependent | 1,500,000 | Lives with taxpayer, adjusted gross income < 1,000,000 KRW |
| Handicapped person | 2,000,000 | Per handicapped household member |
| Elderly (70+) | 1,000,000 | Per person aged 70+ in household |
| Female head of household | 500,000 | Meets criteria |
| Single parent | 1,000,000 | Meets criteria |

### 3.2 Non-Resident Treatment

Non-residents are allowed to claim **only the personal deduction for themselves** (KRW 1,500,000).

## 9. Key Considerations for Config Implementation

### 9.1 Mandatory Inputs

```yaml
inputs:
  - id: gross_annual
    type: number
    label: "Annual Gross Salary"
    unit: "KRW"

  - id: is_flat_tax_eligible
    type: boolean
    label: "Eligible for 19% flat tax?"
    default: false

  - id: flat_tax_elected
    type: boolean
    label: "Elect 19% flat tax?"
    default: false
    show_if: is_flat_tax_eligible

  - id: tax_resident
    type: boolean
    label: "Tax Resident (183+ days)?"
    default: true
```

### 9.2 Critical Calculation Nodes

1. **Earned Income Deduction** - Complex bracket calculation with cap at KRW 20M
2. **Basic Deduction** - KRW 1.5M for taxpayer (non-residents limited to this)
3. **National Income Tax** - 8-bracket progressive system
4. **Local Income Tax** - 10% of national tax
5. **National Pension** - 4.5% (2025) or 4.75% (2026+) with income cap
6. **Health Insurance** - 3.545% (2025) or 3.595% (2026) plus long-term care
7. **Employment Insurance** - 0.9% employee rate
8. **Flat Tax Path** - Alternative calculation bypassing deductions

### 9.3 Config Variants Needed

**Variants to Create:**
1. `flat-tax.yaml` - 19% flat rate election for foreign workers
2. `technical-50pct.yaml` - 50% reduction for qualified technicians (10 years)
3. `technical-70-50pct.yaml` - 70%/50% reduction for parts/equipment industry
4. `researcher.yaml` - 50% reduction for foreign researchers
5. `2026.yaml` - Updated rates for 2026 (pension 9.5%, health 7.19%)

### 9.4 Test Vectors Required

**Income Levels (KRW):**
- Low: 25,000,000 (below avg)
- Median: 50,000,000
- High: 100,000,000
- Very High: 200,000,000

**Scenarios:**
- Standard resident with tax resident status
- Foreign worker with flat tax election
- Technical professional with 50% reduction
- Non-resident (cross-check limitations)

### 9.5 Rounding Considerations

- Tax amounts typically rounded to nearest KRW (no decimals)
- Social insurance contributions rounded to nearest KRW
- Intermediate calculations may use decimals, round at final step

### 9.6 Key Gotchas

1. **Local Tax Always 10%**: Don't forget to add 10% local tax on top of national tax
2. **Earned Income Deduction Cap**: Strictly capped at KRW 20M since 2020
3. **Flat Tax Trade-off**: When elected, ALL deductions/credits forfeited
4. **2026 Rate Changes**: Pension increases to 9.5%, health to 7.19%
5. **Long-term Care**: Calculated as percentage OF health insurance, not separate rate
6. **Reciprocal Agreements**: Check visa type and home country for insurance exemptions
7. **Income Cap on Pension**: KRW 6,370,000 monthly cap (adjusted annually in July)
8. **Non-Resident Limitations**: Only basic personal deduction allowed
