  notes: |
    This configuration covers the standard UK tax system for the 2025/26 tax year
    (6 April 2025 - 5 April 2026) for England, Wales, and Northern Ireland.

    Key features:
    - Personal Allowance: £12,570 (frozen since 2021)
    - Personal Allowance tapers at £1 for every £2 earned over £100,000
    - Progressive income tax brackets: 20%, 40%, 45%
    - Class 1 National Insurance: 8% (£12,570-£50,270), 2% (above £50,270)

    ⚠️ THE £100K TAX TRAP:
    Between £100,000 and £125,140, you face an effective marginal tax rate of 60%
    (or 62% including National Insurance). This occurs because:
    - For every £2 earned over £100k, you lose £1 of Personal Allowance
    - That £1 of "lost allowance" is now taxable at 40% (higher rate)
    - Combined with the 40% tax on the income itself = 60% effective rate
    - Add 2% NI for employees = 62% total

    Example at £101,000 vs £100,000:
    - Extra £1 gross becomes £1.50 extra taxable
    - Tax at 40% = £0.60 + NI 2% = £0.62 total
    - Effective rate: 62% marginal

    Test vectors verify this behavior at key points: £101k, £115k, and £125,140.

    Important notes:
    - Scotland has different income tax rates and bands (use variant if needed)
    - This does not include employer National Insurance contributions
    - Does not include student loan repayments or pension contributions

    title: "⚠️ The £100k Tax Trap - 60% Effective Rate"
    body: |
      If you earn between £100,000 and £125,140, beware the 100k tax trap!

      Your Personal Allowance reduces by £1 for every £2 you earn over £100,000.
      This creates an **effective marginal tax rate of 60%** on income in this range
      (compared to 40% just below £100k).

      For employees, add 2% National Insurance on top = **62% total marginal rate**,
      meaning only 38p of each extra £1 earned reaches your pocket.

      Example: Earning £101,000 instead of £100,000 costs you:
      - £0.60 in income tax (40% on £1.50 extra taxable)
      - £0.02 in National Insurance
      - Net: Only £0.38 of the extra £1 is take-home

      The Personal Allowance is fully eliminated at £125,140, where normal rates resume.

      Consider pension contributions to keep your taxable income below £100,000.
