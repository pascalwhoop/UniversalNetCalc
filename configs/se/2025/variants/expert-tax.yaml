  - id: "expert_tax_calculation"
    title: "How Expert Tax Works"
    body: |
      Enter your GROSS salary (before the 25% exemption). The calculator will automatically
      apply the Expert Tax benefit by making only 75% of your salary taxable.

      Example: On SEK 900,000 gross salary with Expert Tax:
      - Only SEK 675,000 (75%) is taxable
      - SEK 225,000 (25%) is tax-exempt
      - Tax savings: ~SEK 113,000 per year (12.6% of gross)

      The employer still pays full social contributions (31.42%) on your entire salary.
