      Enter your GROSS salary (before the 30% exemption). The calculator will automatically
      apply the Expert Tax benefit by making only 70% of your salary taxable.

      Example: On SEK 900,000 gross salary with Expert Tax 2026:
      - Only SEK 630,000 (70%) is taxable
      - SEK 270,000 (30%) is tax-exempt
      - Tax savings: ~SEK 140,000+ per year (vs ~SEK 113,000 under old 25% rule)

      The employer still pays full social contributions (31.42%) on your entire salary.
