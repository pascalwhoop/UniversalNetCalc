  notes: |
    This configuration covers the standard Dutch tax system for 2025 for individuals
    under AOW (state pension) age. The rates include both income tax and social
    security premiums (AOW, ANW, WLZ).

    Key changes from 2024:
    - Tax brackets adjusted for inflation
    - First bracket rate decreased from 36.97% to 35.82%
    - Second bracket introduced at 37.48% (from €38,441 to €76,817)
    - Top rate of 49.50% applies above €76,817
    - Tax credits adjusted for inflation

    Key assumptions:
    - Taxpayer is under AOW age (retirement age) in 2025
    - Standard employee in Box 1 (income from work and home)
    - Does not include special situations like partial foreign tax liability
