  notes: |
    Singapore uses a progressive personal income tax system for tax residents.
    Year of Assessment (YA) 2026 covers income earned from 1 January to 31 December 2025.

    Key features:
    - First S$20,000 is tax-free
    - Progressive rates from 2% to 24% (unchanged from YA 2024 onwards)
    - No personal income tax rebate for YA 2026 (unlike YA 2025 which had a 60% SG60 rebate capped at S$200)
    - No social security contributions for employees (CPF applies to citizens/PRs only)
    - This calculator is for tax residents only

    CPF rates increased from 1 January 2026 for workers aged above 55–65:
    - Above 55–60: total 34% (employee 18%, employer 16%)
    - Above 60–65: total 25% (employee 12.5%, employer 12.5%)
    - These are retirement savings contributions, not income taxes

    Non-residents are taxed at a flat 15% or progressive rates (whichever is higher)
    and are not covered by this configuration.

  - id: "salary_input"
    title: "Annual Chargeable Income"
    body: |
      Enter your annual chargeable income (gross salary minus deductions and reliefs).
      For most employees, this is your gross salary before personal reliefs.
      The calculator does not include CPF contributions, which apply only to
      Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents.
    severity: "info"

  - id: "resident_only"
    title: "Tax Residents Only"
    body: |
      This calculator is for Singapore tax residents only. You are a tax resident if you:
      - Are a Singapore Citizen or Permanent Resident (with some exceptions), OR
      - Stayed/worked in Singapore for at least 183 days in the calendar year

      Non-residents are taxed differently (15% flat or progressive rates, whichever is higher).

  - id: "cpf_not_included"
    title: "CPF Contributions Not Included"
    body: |
      CPF (Central Provident Fund) contributions are mandatory for Singapore Citizens
      and Permanent Residents but are NOT a tax. They are retirement savings contributions.
      This calculator shows income tax only. For Citizens/PRs, actual take-home pay will be
      further reduced by employee CPF contributions (up to 20% capped at monthly wages).

      CPF rates were updated from 1 January 2026 for workers aged above 55–65.
