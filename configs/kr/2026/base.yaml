  notes: |
    This configuration covers the standard South Korean tax system for 2026.

    Key features:
    - Progressive income tax (6% to 45%) with 8 tax brackets (unchanged from 2025)
    - Local income tax (10% of national income tax)
    - Earned income deduction (complex 5-bracket formula, capped at KRW 20M)
    - Basic personal deduction (KRW 1.5M)
    - National pension (4.75%, increased from 4.5% in 2025; capped at KRW 6,370,000/month Jan-Jun 2026)
    - Health insurance (3.595%, increased from 3.545% in 2025)
    - Long-term care (13.14% of health insurance, rate 0.9448% of salary)
    - Employment insurance (0.9%, unchanged)

    Key changes from 2025:
    - National Pension rate increased: 4.5% → 4.75% (employee share)
      The total NPS rate increases from 9.0% to 9.5% as part of a gradual reform
      reaching 13.0% by 2033 (National Pension Act amendment, effective Jan 1, 2026)
    - Health insurance rate increased: 3.545% → 3.595% (employee share of total 7.19%)
    - Long-term care rate increased: 0.9182% → 0.9448% of salary (13.14% of health insurance)
    - Income tax brackets: unchanged from 2025

    Pension cap notes:
    - The monthly cap is KRW 6,370,000 from Jan-Jun 2026 (same as 2025)
    - From July 2026, the cap will rise to KRW 6,590,000
    - This config uses the Jan-Jun 2026 cap of KRW 6,370,000 for simplicity;
      actual annual pension may vary slightly for high earners

    Key assumptions:
    - Tax resident (183+ days in Korea)
    - Standard employee with earned income
    - No special exemptions or reductions
