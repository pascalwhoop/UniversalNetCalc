## Executive Summary

Norway operates a **dual tax base system** with two types of income:

1. **General Income** (alminnelig inntekt) - taxed at flat 22%
2. **Personal Income** (personinntekt) - subject to progressive bracket tax (1.7% to 17.7%)

Key characteristics for internationally mobile workers:

- **PAYE Scheme**: Simplified 25% flat tax for foreign workers earning below NOK 697,150 (2025)
- **National Insurance**: 7.7% on wage income above NOK 99,650 (2025)
- **Municipal Tax**: Uniform 22% rate across most municipalities
- **Wealth Tax**: Applies to global assets for tax residents, Norwegian assets only for non-residents
- **Standard Deductions**: Personal allowance (personfradrag) and minimum standard deduction (minstefradrag)

---

## Income Tax Structure

### General Income Tax (22% Flat Rate)

**Components of the 22% rate:**
- **Fellesskatt** (Joint tax to state): 6.60%
- **Fylkesskatt** (County tax): Maximum 2.65%
- **Kommuneskatt** (Municipal tax): Maximum 12.75%

**Tax Base**: All categories of taxable income including:
- Employment income and benefits in kind
- Pension income
- Business income (self-proprietorship)
- Capital income

**Regional Exception**: Taxpayers in Finnmark county and certain municipalities in Troms county (Karlsøy, Kvænangen, Kåfjord, Lyngen, Nordreisa, Skjervøy, and Storfjord) pay only 18.5% total tax (fellesskatt rate of 3.1% instead of 6.60%).

### Personal Income Tax (Bracket Tax)

Personal income comprises:
- Income from employment including benefits in kind
- Pension income
- Income from self-proprietorship
- Certain remuneration from partnerships

Personal income is subject to **both** the 22% general income tax **and** progressive bracket tax.

---

## National Insurance Contributions (Trygdeavgift)

National insurance contributions fund Norway's social security system, including healthcare, pensions, and unemployment benefits.

### 2025 Rates

| Income Type | Rate | Threshold |
|-------------|------|-----------|
| Wage earners | 7.7% | Above NOK 99,650 |
| Self-employed | 10.9% | Above NOK 99,650 |
| Pension income | 5.1% | Above NOK 99,650 |
| Disability benefits | 7.7% | Above NOK 99,650 |
| Individuals under 17 or over 69 | 5.1% | Above NOK 99,650 |

**Key Changes for 2025:**
- Rate decreased from 7.8% to 7.7% for wage earners
- Tax exemption threshold increased from NOK 70,000 to NOK 100,000
- Temporary 5% additional employer contribution on salaries exceeding NOK 850,000 was discontinued

**Maximum Contribution Limit**: The contribution may not constitute more than 25% of income for amounts in excess of NOK 99,650.

**Tax Deductibility**: The employee's national insurance contribution is **not** deductible for tax purposes.

---

## Bracket Tax (Trinnskatt)

Bracket tax is a progressive state tax on personal income, applied **on top of** the 22% general income tax.

### 2024 Rates

| Income Range (NOK) | Marginal Rate |
|-------------------|---------------|
| 0 - 217,400 | 0% |
| 217,401 - 306,050 | 1.7% |
| 306,051 - 697,150 | 4.0% |
| 697,151 - 942,400 | 13.7% |
| 942,401 - 1,410,750 | 16.7% |
| 1,410,751+ | 17.7% |

### 2025 Rates

| Income Range (NOK) | Marginal Rate |
|-------------------|---------------|
| 0 - 217,400 | 0% |
| 217,401 - 306,050 | 1.7% |
| 306,051 - 697,150 | 4.0% |
| 697,151 - 942,400 | 13.7% |
| 942,401 - 1,410,750 | 16.7% |
| 1,410,751+ | 17.7% |

**Note**: The 2024 and 2025 bracket tax thresholds and rates are identical.

### Regional Reduction

Residents of **Finnmark** and **Nord-Troms** receive a reduction in the 13.7% bracket tax rate.

### Maximum Effective Marginal Tax Rate

The maximum effective marginal tax rate in Norway is approximately **39.6%**, which occurs when combining:
- General income tax: 22%
- Bracket tax (top rate): 17.7%
- This does not include national insurance contributions, which would bring the total to 47.3%

---

## PAYE Scheme for Foreign Workers

The **Pay As You Earn (PAYE)** scheme is a simplified voluntary tax system for foreign workers who are new to Norway or have short-term work assignments.

### Eligibility Criteria

**You CAN join PAYE if:**
- You earn less than NOK 697,150 (2025) or NOK 725,050 (2026)
- You are NOT a Norwegian tax resident, OR
- You have work stays under 183 days in any 12-month period, OR
- You have work stays under 270 days in any 36-month period

**You CANNOT join PAYE if:**
- Your income exceeds the threshold
- You have been a tax resident for over one year
- You receive Norwegian public benefits
- You have business income or other taxable Norwegian income
- You have capital income exceeding NOK 10,000
- You work offshore or are a seaman on ships

### Tax Rates

**Standard PAYE Rate**: 25% (includes 7.7% national insurance contributions)

**Reduced PAYE Rate** (if exempted from national insurance): 17.4% in 2025, 17.4% in 2026

The effective income tax component is therefore 17.3% (25% - 7.7%).

### Key Features

**Advantages:**
- Simple: No tax return required
- Final: Tax is final at payment, not subject to change
- Automatic: Tax is deducted by employer
- No paperwork: No tax assessment notice

**Disadvantages:**
- No deductions: Cannot claim commuting expenses, interest deductions, etc.
- Income limit: Only available for income below NOK 697,150 (2025)
- Potential overpayment: May pay more than under general taxation rules if eligible for significant deductions

### Comparison: PAYE vs. General Taxation

| Aspect | PAYE | General Taxation |
|--------|------|------------------|
| Tax Rate | Flat 25% | 22% + bracket tax + 7.7% NI |
| Tax Deduction | Immediate | Calculated annually |
| Tax Return | None required | Required |
| Refunds | No assessment | Tax assessment notice |
| Deductions | Not allowed | Allowed (expenses, interest) |
| Income Limit | NOK 697,150 (2025) | No limit |
| Complexity | Very simple | Complex |
| Opt-out Period | By Dec 31, three years after income year | N/A |

### When PAYE is Beneficial

PAYE is typically beneficial for foreign workers who:
- Have short-term assignments (less than 183 days)
- Earn below the threshold
- Have few deductible expenses
- Prefer simplicity over potential tax savings
- Want certainty and no year-end surprises

### When General Taxation is Better

General taxation may be better for workers who:
- Earn above NOK 697,150
- Have significant deductible expenses (commuting, interest payments)
- Plan to stay in Norway long-term
- Are willing to file annual tax returns

---

## Standard Deductions

Norwegian tax law provides automatic deductions that reduce taxable income.

### Personal Allowance (Personfradrag) - 2025

**Amount**: NOK 108,550 (increased from NOK 88,250 in 2024)

**Description**:
- Fixed deduction given to all residents of Norway
- Regardless of income source
- Applied when calculating general income taxed at 22%
- Proportionally reduced if residing in Norway for only part of the year

**Example**: If you only live in Norway for 6 months (183 days) in 2025, your personal allowance would be approximately NOK 54,275 (108,550 × 183/365).

### Minimum Standard Deduction (Minstefradrag) - 2025

**For Employment Income**:
- **Rate**: 46% of income from work
- **Maximum**: NOK 92,000 (decreased from NOK 104,450 in 2024)

**For Pension Income**:
- **Maximum**: NOK 73,150

**Calculation**: The deduction is the lower of:
1. 46% of gross employment income
2. NOK 92,000

**Example**:
- Gross salary: NOK 150,000
- 46% × 150,000 = NOK 69,000
- Deduction: NOK 69,000 (below the NOK 92,000 cap)

**Example 2**:
- Gross salary: NOK 300,000
- 46% × 300,000 = NOK 138,000
- Deduction: NOK 92,000 (capped at maximum)

**Automatic Application**: The minimum standard deduction is normally entered automatically in tax returns.

### How Deductions Work Together

**Taxable Income Calculation:**

1. **Gross Income** (e.g., NOK 500,000)
2. **Minus Minstefradrag** (e.g., -NOK 92,000)
3. **Minus Other Deductions** (interest, expenses, etc.)
4. **= General Income** (e.g., NOK 408,000)
5. **Minus Personfradrag** (-NOK 108,550)
6. **= Taxable General Income** (NOK 299,450)
7. **Tax at 22%** = NOK 65,879

Bracket tax and national insurance are then calculated separately on personal income (before deductions).

---

## Municipal Variations

### Municipal Income Tax

Unlike some countries where municipal income tax rates vary significantly, Norway has a **relatively uniform system**.

**Standard Rate**: The 22% general income tax includes municipal tax (kommuneskatt) of up to 12.75%, which is the **maximum rate set by the Storting** (Norwegian Parliament).

**Practice**: Most Norwegian municipalities, including Oslo, Bergen, and Stavanger, adopt the **maximum rate of 12.75%**.

**Why No Variation?**:
- The Storting sets maximum rates annually
- Municipalities must adopt rates within these limits when preparing budgets
- In practice, nearly all municipalities adopt the maximum rates to fund local services

**Special Case**: Only Finnmark county and certain Troms municipalities have different rates (total 18.5% instead of 22%).

### Major Cities - 2025 Income Tax

| Municipality | Municipal Tax Component | Total Income Tax Rate |
|--------------|------------------------|----------------------|
| **Oslo** | 12.75% | 22% |
| **Bergen** | 12.75% | 22% |
| **Stavanger** | 12.75% | 22% |
| **Trondheim** | 12.75% | 22% |
| **Tromsø** | 12.75% | 22% |

### Property Tax (Eiendomsskatt)

While **income tax** is uniform, **property tax** is optional and varies significantly by municipality:

**Rate Range**: 1‰ to 4‰ (0.1% to 0.4%) of property value
- Oslo: Varies by district
- Bergen: Property tax applies
- Stavanger: Property tax applies

Property tax is decided by each municipal council and is **separate from income tax**.

### County Tax (Fylkesskatt)

**Standard Rate**: 2.65% (included in the 22% general income tax)

**Regional Exception**:
- Finnmark: Lower rate
- Certain Troms municipalities: Lower rate

---

## Wealth Tax (Formuesskatt)

Norway levies a **net wealth tax** on both individuals' global assets (for tax residents) and Norwegian assets (for non-residents).

### 2025 Rates and Thresholds

**Municipal Wealth Tax**:
- **Rate**: 0.525%
- **Threshold**:
  - Single/unmarried: NOK 1,760,000
  - Married/spouses: NOK 3,520,000

**State Wealth Tax**:
- **Rate**: 0.475% on assets between NOK 1,760,000 and NOK 20,700,000
- **Higher Rate**: 0.575% on assets exceeding NOK 20,700,000
- **Threshold**:
  - Single/unmarried: NOK 1,760,000
  - Married/spouses: NOK 3,520,000

**Maximum Combined Rate**: 1.1% (0.525% + 0.575%)

### Calculation Example

**Single person with net wealth of NOK 5,000,000:**

1. **Municipal wealth tax**:
   - Taxable wealth: 5,000,000 - 1,760,000 = 3,240,000
   - Tax: 3,240,000 × 0.525% = NOK 17,010

2. **State wealth tax**:
   - Taxable wealth: 5,000,000 - 1,760,000 = 3,240,000
   - Tax: 3,240,000 × 0.475% = NOK 15,390

3. **Total wealth tax**: NOK 32,400

### Rules for Foreign Residents and Expats

**Tax Residents** (typically after 6 months or when center of economic interest is Norway):
- Must declare and pay wealth tax on **entire global assets**
- Includes foreign bank accounts, real estate, shares, investments
- Same thresholds and rates as Norwegian citizens

**Non-Residents** (limited tax liability):
- Subject to wealth tax only on **Norwegian assets**
- **No threshold for municipal wealth tax** - taxed from the first NOK
- State wealth tax threshold still applies (NOK 1,760,000)

**Assets Included**:
- Bank deposits (Norwegian and foreign for residents)
- Shares and securities
- Real property (real estate)
- Vehicles (cars, boats)
- Business assets

**Assets Excluded/Discounted**:
- Primary residence: Valued at lower rate (typically 25% discount)
- Business assets in active companies: Various discounts
- Pension savings: Often exempt

### Double Taxation Relief

If you've paid wealth tax abroad on the same assets that are taxable in Norway, you can claim a deduction for the foreign tax in your Norwegian tax return.

**Important**: Norway has comprehensive tax treaties with many countries to prevent double taxation.

### 2026 Changes

**Threshold Increase**: From NOK 1,760,000 (2025) to NOK 1,900,000 (2026)

## Tax Calculation Examples

### Example 1: Norwegian Resident, Median Income (NOK 500,000)

**Gross Annual Salary**: NOK 500,000

**Step 1: Calculate General Income Tax Base**
- Gross income: NOK 500,000
- Minus minstefradrag: -NOK 92,000 (46% capped)
- General income: NOK 408,000
- Minus personfradrag: -NOK 108,550
- Taxable general income: NOK 299,450

**Step 2: General Income Tax (22%)**
- Tax: NOK 299,450 × 22% = **NOK 65,879**

**Step 3: Bracket Tax (on personal income before deductions)**
- NOK 217,400 at 0% = NOK 0
- NOK 88,650 (306,050 - 217,400) at 1.7% = NOK 1,507
- NOK 193,950 (500,000 - 306,050) at 4.0% = NOK 7,758
- **Total bracket tax: NOK 9,265**

**Step 4: National Insurance (7.7%)**
- Taxable income: NOK 500,000 - 99,650 = NOK 400,350
- Contribution: NOK 400,350 × 7.7% = **NOK 30,827**

**Total Tax**: NOK 65,879 + NOK 9,265 + NOK 30,827 = **NOK 105,971**

**Net Salary**: NOK 500,000 - NOK 105,971 = **NOK 394,029**

**Effective Tax Rate**: 21.2%

---

### Example 2: Foreign Worker on PAYE Scheme (NOK 600,000)

**Gross Annual Salary**: NOK 600,000

**PAYE Tax (25%)**
- Tax: NOK 600,000 × 25% = **NOK 150,000**

**Net Salary**: NOK 600,000 - NOK 150,000 = **NOK 450,000**

**Effective Tax Rate**: 25%

**Comparison with General Taxation** (same income):

Following Example 1 methodology:
- General income tax: ~NOK 78,000
- Bracket tax: ~NOK 16,000
- National insurance: ~NOK 38,500
- Total: ~NOK 132,500

**PAYE Disadvantage**: NOK 17,500 more tax (3.9 percentage points higher)

**Note**: This assumes no other deductions. If the worker has significant deductible expenses (commuting, interest), the difference would be even larger.

---

### Example 3: High Earner, Tax Resident (NOK 1,500,000)

**Gross Annual Salary**: NOK 1,500,000

**Step 1: Calculate General Income Tax Base**
- Gross income: NOK 1,500,000
- Minus minstefradrag: -NOK 92,000
- General income: NOK 1,408,000
- Minus personfradrag: -NOK 108,550
- Taxable general income: NOK 1,299,450

**Step 2: General Income Tax (22%)**
- Tax: NOK 1,299,450 × 22% = **NOK 285,879**

**Step 3: Bracket Tax**
- 0 - 217,400 at 0% = NOK 0
- 217,401 - 306,050 (88,650) at 1.7% = NOK 1,507
- 306,051 - 697,150 (391,100) at 4.0% = NOK 15,644
- 697,151 - 942,400 (245,250) at 13.7% = NOK 33,599
- 942,401 - 1,410,750 (468,350) at 16.7% = NOK 78,214
- 1,410,751 - 1,500,000 (89,250) at 17.7% = NOK 15,797
- **Total bracket tax: NOK 144,761**

**Step 4: National Insurance (7.7%)**
- Taxable income: NOK 1,500,000 - 99,650 = NOK 1,400,350
- Contribution: NOK 1,400,350 × 7.7% = **NOK 107,827**

**Total Tax**: NOK 285,879 + NOK 144,761 + NOK 107,827 = **NOK 538,467**

**Net Salary**: NOK 1,500,000 - NOK 538,467 = **NOK 961,533**

**Effective Tax Rate**: 35.9%

**Plus Wealth Tax** (if net wealth > NOK 1,760,000):
- Example: Net wealth of NOK 5,000,000
- Wealth tax: ~NOK 32,400 (see wealth tax calculation above)
- **Total tax including wealth**: NOK 570,867
- **Total effective rate**: 38.1%

---

### Example 4: Foreign Worker Above PAYE Threshold (NOK 750,000)

**Gross Annual Salary**: NOK 750,000

**Not eligible for PAYE** (exceeds NOK 697,150 threshold)

Must use general taxation rules:

**Step 1: General Income Tax**
- Gross: NOK 750,000
- Minus minstefradrag: -NOK 92,000
- General income: NOK 658,000
- Minus personfradrag: -NOK 108,550
- Taxable: NOK 549,450
- Tax at 22%: **NOK 120,879**

**Step 2: Bracket Tax**
- Following calculation methodology: **~NOK 26,500**

**Step 3: National Insurance**
- (750,000 - 99,650) × 7.7% = **NOK 50,097**

**Total Tax**: ~**NOK 197,476**

**Net Salary**: ~**NOK 552,524**

**Effective Tax Rate**: 26.3%

## Key Takeaways for Config Implementation

### 1. Two-Tier System

Norway has a **dual taxation system**:
- **General income**: 22% flat (includes municipal, county, and state taxes)
- **Personal income**: Additional progressive bracket tax (0-17.7%)

Both apply to the same income (employment, self-employment, pensions).

### 2. PAYE Scheme is Unique

The **PAYE scheme** is a critical feature for internationally mobile workers:
- Flat 25% rate (including 7.7% national insurance)
- Available only to foreign workers earning below NOK 697,150 (2025)
- No deductions allowed
- No tax return required
- Voluntary (can opt for general taxation)

**Implementation**: Should be a variant of the base Norway config.

### 3. National Insurance is Progressive

National insurance (trygdeavgift):
- Exempt up to NOK 99,650
- 7.7% on wage income above threshold (2025)
- Capped at 25% of income above threshold

### 4. Multiple Deductions Apply

**Deduction order**:
1. Minstefradrag (46% of income, max NOK 92,000) - reduces general income
2. Other deductions (interest, commuting) - reduce general income
3. Personfradrag (NOK 108,550) - reduces taxable general income

**Tax calculation order**:
1. Calculate general income (after minstefradrag and other deductions)
2. Apply personfradrag
3. Calculate tax at 22%
4. Calculate bracket tax on personal income (before deductions)
5. Calculate national insurance on gross income (above NOK 99,650)

### 5. Regional Variations are Limited

For income tax:
- Most municipalities: Standard 22% rate
- Finnmark and certain Troms municipalities: 18.5% rate

For property and wealth tax: More variation exists but these are separate from income tax.

### 6. Wealth Tax Matters for Expats

**Important consideration**:
- Tax residents: Global wealth taxed
- Non-residents: Norwegian wealth only, no threshold for municipal component

Wealth tax should be mentioned in notices but may be out of scope for the salary calculator.

### 7. Test Vectors Should Include

**Scenarios to test**:
1. Low income (below NOK 217,400) - no bracket tax
2. Median income (NOK 500,000) - 1.7% and 4% brackets
3. High income (NOK 1,500,000) - all bracket levels

## Implementation Notes

### Base Configuration (General Taxation Rules)

**Inputs needed**:
- `gross_annual` (annual salary)
- `region` (for Finnmark/Troms exception, optional)

**Parameters**:
- General income tax rate: 22% (or 18.5% for special regions)
- National insurance rate: 7.7%
- National insurance threshold: 99,650
- National insurance cap: 25% of income above threshold
- Personfradrag: 108,550
- Minstefradrag max: 92,000
- Minstefradrag rate: 46%
- Bracket thresholds: [217400, 306050, 697150, 942400, 1410750]
- Bracket rates: [0, 0.017, 0.04, 0.137, 0.167, 0.177]

**Calculation nodes**:
1. `minstefradrag` = min(gross_annual × 0.46, 92000)
2. `general_income` = gross_annual - minstefradrag
3. `taxable_income` = max(0, general_income - personfradrag)
4. `general_income_tax` = taxable_income × 0.22
5. `bracket_tax` = bracket_tax_function(gross_annual)
6. `ni_base` = max(0, gross_annual - 99650)
7. `ni_uncapped` = ni_base × 0.077
8. `ni_cap` = ni_base × 0.25
9. `national_insurance` = min(ni_uncapped, ni_cap)
10. `total_tax` = general_income_tax + bracket_tax + national_insurance
11. `net` = gross_annual - total_tax

### PAYE Variant

**Conditions**:
- Only available if gross_annual ≤ 697,150

**Calculation**:
- `total_tax` = gross_annual × 0.25
- `net` = gross_annual × 0.75

**Notices**:
- Explain PAYE scheme limitations (no deductions)
- Show comparison with general taxation
- Mention opt-out provisions
