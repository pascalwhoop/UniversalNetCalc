# Ireland Tax System Research Document
## For Internationally Mobile Workers (2024-2025)

**Research Date:** January 23, 2026
**Target Years:** 2024, 2025
**Focus:** Income tax, USC, PRSI, tax credits, and special expat regimes

---

## Executive Summary

Ireland operates a two-tier income tax system (20% and 40%) combined with the Universal Social Charge (USC) and Pay-Related Social Insurance (PRSI). The tax system is **uniform nationwide** with no regional variations for income tax. A special regime called **SARP (Special Assignee Relief Programme)** provides significant tax relief for high-earning foreign assignees.

**Key rates for 2025:**
- Income tax: 20% / 40%
- USC: 0.5% / 2% / 3% / 8% (progressive bands)
- Employee PRSI: 4.2% (from October 1, 2025)
- Standard tax credits: €4,000 combined (Personal €2,000 + Employee €2,000)

---

## 1. Income Tax Structure

### 1.1 Tax Rates and Bands (2025)

Ireland uses a simple two-rate progressive tax system:

| Filing Status | Standard Rate Band (20%) | Higher Rate (40%) |
|---------------|-------------------------|-------------------|
| Single | €53,000 | Balance |
| Married/Civil Partners (one income) | €53,000 | Balance |
| Married/Civil Partners (both working) | €53,000 + up to €35,000 | Balance |

**2024 comparison:** The single person standard rate band was €51,000 in 2024, increased to €53,000 in 2025.

### 1.2 How It Works

Income tax is calculated on gross employment income before most deductions. The system uses PAYE (Pay As You Earn) withholding at source.

**Example calculation for €60,000 gross (single, 2025):**
- First €53,000 @ 20% = €10,600
- Remaining €7,000 @ 40% = €2,800
- **Total income tax before credits:** €13,400

---

## 2. Universal Social Charge (USC)

### 2.1 Overview

The USC is a separate tax on gross income introduced in 2011. It applies to income over €13,000 per year.

### 2.2 USC Rates and Bands (2025)

**Standard rates (2025):**

| Rate | Income Band |
|------|-------------|
| 0.5% | €0 - €12,012 |
| 2% | €12,012.01 - €27,382 |
| 3% | €28,700.01 - €70,044 |
| 8% | €70,044.01 and over |
| 11% | Self-employed income over €100,000 only |

**2026 update:** The 2% band upper limit increased from €27,382 to €28,700 in 2026.

**Exemption:** If total income is €13,000 or less, no USC is payable.

### 2.3 Reduced USC Rates

Lower rates apply to specific groups:

| Rate | Income Band |
|------|-------------|
| 0.5% | Up to €12,012 |
| 2% | All income over €12,012 |

**Eligibility for reduced rates:**
- People aged 70+ with income ≤ €60,000
- Medical card holders under 70 with income ≤ €60,000

### 2.4 USC Calculation Example

For €50,000 gross income (2025):
- 0.5% on first €12,012 = €60.06
- 2% on €12,012.01 to €27,382 (€15,370) = €307.40
- 3% on €27,382.01 to €50,000 (€22,618) = €678.54
- **Total USC: €1,046**

### 2.5 Important Notes

- Department of Social Protection pensions are exempt from USC
- Occupational pensions ARE subject to USC
- USC applies only on lump-sum pension payments exceeding €500,000
- USC has no reliefs or credits - it's calculated directly on income

---

## 3. PRSI (Pay-Related Social Insurance)

### 3.1 Overview

PRSI is Ireland's social insurance system, funding state pensions, unemployment benefits, and healthcare. Most employees fall under **Class A PRSI**.

### 3.2 Employee PRSI Rates (Class A)

**2024:**
- 4.1% on all earnings over €352/week

**2025:**
- 4.1% (January 1 - September 30, 2025)
- **4.2%** (October 1, 2025 onwards) on all earnings over €352/week

**2026 and beyond:**
- 4.35% (from October 1, 2026)

### 3.3 PRSI Thresholds and Credits (2025)

| Weekly Earnings | Employee PRSI |
|----------------|---------------|
| ≤ €352 | 0% (no PRSI) |
| €352.01 - €424 | 4.2% with tapered credit |
| > €424 | 4.2% on all earnings |

**Tapered credit example:**
- Earnings: €352.01/week
- PRSI @ 4.2%: €14.78
- Less tapered credit: €12
- **Net PRSI payable: €2.78**

### 3.4 Employer PRSI Rates (Class A)

**2025 rates:**

| Period | Weekly Earnings ≤ €552 | Weekly Earnings > €552 |
|--------|------------------------|------------------------|
| January 1 - September 30, 2025 | 8.9% | 11.15% |
| October 1, 2025 onwards | 9% | 11.25% |

**2026:** 9.15% (low) / 11.4% (high) from October 1, 2026

**Note:** Employer PRSI is not deducted from employee pay - it's an employer cost.

### 3.5 Self-Assessment Blended Rate

Due to the mid-year rate change on October 1, 2025, for self-assessment income tax returns, a **blended rate of 4.125%** applies for the full 2025 tax year.

---

## 4. Tax Credits

### 4.1 Standard Personal Tax Credits (2025)

Tax credits directly reduce the amount of income tax payable (after calculating tax on gross income).

| Credit Type | 2025 Amount | 2024 Amount | Eligibility |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Personal Tax Credit (Single) | €2,000 | €1,875 | All taxpayers |
| Personal Tax Credit (Married/Civil Partners) | €4,000 | €3,750 | Married or civil partners |
| Employee Tax Credit | €2,000 | €1,875 | PAYE employees with income ≥ €10,000 |
| Earned Income Tax Credit | €2,000 | €1,875 | Self-employed (max) |

### 4.2 Employee Tax Credit Details

The Employee Tax Credit (formerly PAYE Credit) applies to:
- Employees receiving PAYE income
- Pension recipients
- Recipients of taxable social welfare payments (e.g., Jobseeker's Benefit)

**Reduced credit for low earners:**
- If PAYE income < €10,000, the credit is capped at 20% of that income
- Example: €8,000 PAYE income = €1,600 Employee Tax Credit (not €2,000)

### 4.3 Other Common Credits (2025)

| Credit Type | Amount | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| Incapacitated Child | €3,800 | Per child |
| Dependent Relative | €305 | Income limit €18,028 |
| Blind Person (single) | €1,950 | Medical certification required |
| Blind Person (couple, one blind) | €1,950 | |
| Blind Person (couple, both blind) | €3,900 | |
| Home Carer Tax Credit | €1,950 | Income limit applies |
| Rent Tax Credit (single) | €1,000 | Max amount |
| Rent Tax Credit (couple) | €2,000 | Max amount |

### 4.4 Combined Tax Credit Example

**Single PAYE employee earning €30,000+ (2025):**
- Personal Tax Credit: €2,000
- Employee Tax Credit: €2,000
- **Total credits: €4,000**

This means if you earn ≤ €20,000, you pay **zero income tax** (your €4,000 in credits exceeds the tax due on €20,000).

## 5. Special Assignee Relief Programme (SARP)

### 5.1 Overview

SARP is Ireland's expat tax relief program for highly-paid foreign workers assigned to Ireland. It provides a **30% tax deduction** on income above a threshold.

**Program status:**
- Available for assignments during tax years 2012-2025
- Relief available for up to **5 consecutive tax years** from first arrival
- **Important:** Program currently scheduled to end December 31, 2025 (no new entrants after this date unless extended)

### 5.2 Eligibility Criteria (2024-2025)

To qualify for SARP, you must meet ALL of the following:

1. **Minimum salary:** €100,000 per annum (basic salary only, excluding bonuses/commissions)
   - Prior to 2023: €75,000 threshold
   - From January 1, 2026: €125,000 threshold (if program extended)

2. **Prior employment:** Employed by the relevant employer outside Ireland for at least 6 months before assignment

3. **Assignment duration:** Minimum 12 months assignment to Ireland

4. **Tax residency:** Must be Irish tax resident for all years claiming the relief

5. **Employer notification:** Employer must notify Revenue Commissioners within 90 days of employee's arrival

### 5.3 How SARP Relief Works

**The 30% deduction (2023-2025):**
- Relief calculated as 30% of income over €100,000
- **Upper income cap:** €1 million (relief stops on income above this)
- The deduction reduces taxable income for income tax purposes only

**Important limitations:**
- USC and PRSI still apply to the full income (including the SARP deduction amount)
- Only employment income qualifies (not self-employment or investment income)

### 5.4 SARP Calculation Example (2025)

**Scenario:** Employee earns €150,000 gross salary

1. **Calculate SARP deduction:**
   - Income above threshold: €150,000 - €100,000 = €50,000
   - SARP deduction (30%): €50,000 × 30% = €15,000

2. **Income tax calculation:**
   - Taxable income: €150,000 - €15,000 = €135,000
   - Tax @ 20% on €53,000: €10,600
   - Tax @ 40% on €82,000: €32,800
   - Total tax before credits: €43,400
   - Less tax credits (€4,000): **€39,400 income tax**

3. **USC calculation (on full €150,000):**
   - €12,012 @ 0.5% = €60.06
   - €15,370 @ 2% = €307.40
   - €42,662 @ 3% = €1,279.86
   - €79,956 @ 8% = €6,396.48
   - **Total USC: €8,043.80**

4. **PRSI calculation (on full €150,000):**
   - €150,000 @ 4.2% = €6,300

5. **Total taxes:**
   - Income tax: €39,400
   - USC: €8,043.80
   - PRSI: €6,300
   - **Total: €53,743.80**
   - **Effective rate: 35.8%**

**Without SARP (comparison):**
- Income tax would be €49,400 (€10,000 more)
- Total taxes: €63,743.80
- Effective rate: 42.5%

**Tax saved: €10,000 per year**

### 5.5 SARP vs Standard Taxation Summary

| Income Level | SARP Benefit (Annual Tax Saving) |
|--------------|----------------------------------|
| €100,000 | €0 (at threshold) |
| €120,000 | €2,400 (30% of €20k × 40% = €2,400) |
| €150,000 | €6,000 |
| €200,000 | €12,000 |
| €500,000 | €48,000 |
| €1,000,000+ | €108,000 (capped at €900k relief) |

### 5.6 Employer Obligations

Employers must:
1. Notify Revenue within 90 days of employee's arrival in Ireland
2. Report SARP relief on employee's payslip
3. Submit year-end Form P35 with SARP details
4. Maintain records of SARP calculations

---

## 6. Tax Residency Rules

### 6.1 The 183-Day Rule

You are **resident for tax purposes** if you spend **183 days or more** in Ireland during a tax year (January 1 - December 31).

- You are "present" if you are in Ireland at any time during a day (even 1 hour counts)
- Tax year = calendar year in Ireland

### 6.2 The 280-Day Rule (Look-Back Rule)

You are also resident in Year 2 if you spend **280 days or more** in Ireland over **2 consecutive tax years**, provided you are present for at least 31 days in each year.

**Example:**
- Year 1: 100 days in Ireland
- Year 2: 180 days in Ireland
- Combined: 280 days → **You are resident in Year 2**

This "look-back" rule catches many expats by surprise.

### 6.3 Ordinary Residence

You become **ordinarily resident** if you have been Irish resident for 3 consecutive tax years. This status continues until you have been non-resident for 3 consecutive years.

Ordinary residence extends certain Irish tax obligations (e.g., worldwide income taxation with foreign tax credits).

### 6.4 Split-Year Treatment for Expats

Ireland offers **limited split-year treatment** for arriving and departing employees.

**Arriving in Ireland:**
- Must be coming for more than a temporary purpose
- Must intend to be Irish tax resident in the following year
- If qualified, taxed as resident only from date of arrival

**Leaving Ireland:**
- Must be leaving for more than a temporary purpose
- Must have no intention of being Irish tax resident in the following year
- If qualified, taxed as resident only until date of departure

**Critical limitation:** Split-year treatment applies **only to employment income**, not investment income or other sources.

**Comparison to UK:** Ireland's split-year rules are more restrictive than the UK's Statutory Residence Test split-year provisions.

### 6.5 Tax Implications of Residency

**Irish resident:**
- Taxed on worldwide income
- Entitled to full tax credits and reliefs
- Must file Irish tax returns

**Non-resident:**
- Taxed only on Irish-source income
- Limited tax credits (typically pro-rated)
- May still need to file returns if receiving Irish income

**Temporary non-resident:** If you were ordinarily resident and leave Ireland but remain connected (e.g., maintain property), special rules apply to certain income (e.g., Irish rental income).

---

## 7. Regional Variations

### 7.1 Income Tax: No Regional Differences

Ireland's income tax, USC, and PRSI systems are **uniform nationwide**. There are no:
- Regional income tax surcharges
- County-level income taxes
- Municipal income taxes
- Cantonal systems (unlike Switzerland)

All rates and bands apply equally whether you live in Dublin, Cork, Galway, or rural areas.

### 7.2 Local Property Tax (LPT)

The only tax with regional variation is the **Local Property Tax**, which applies to property owners (not income).

- Local authorities can vary the LPT rate by up to ±15% (increasing to +25% from 2027)
- This affects property owners, not employees
- Not relevant to gross-to-net salary calculations

### 7.3 Implication for Calculator

For the universal salary calculator:
- **No regional inputs required** for Ireland
- Single calculation model applies nationwide
- Simpler than Switzerland, US, or Canada implementations

---

## 8. Complete Calculation Example (2025)

### Scenario: Single Employee, €60,000 Gross Annual Salary

### Marginal Tax Rate at €60,000

The marginal rate is the tax paid on the next euro earned:
- Income tax: 40%
- USC: 3%
- PRSI: 4.2%
- **Total marginal rate: 47.2%**

## 9. Key Differences for Expats vs Local Workers

| Aspect | Local Worker | Expat (SARP Eligible) |
|--------|--------------|------------------------|
| Minimum income | No minimum | €100,000+ required |
| Income tax relief | None | 30% deduction on income > €100k |

| Max relief duration | N/A | 5 consecutive years |
| Notification requirement | None | Employer must notify Revenue |
| Residency requirement | Any | Must be Irish tax resident |

---

## 10. Important Considerations for Mobile Workers

### 10.1 Social Security Totalization Agreements

Ireland has social security agreements with:
- All EU/EEA countries
- UK
- USA
- Canada
- Australia
- Japan
- South Korea
- And others

**Implication:** If you're assigned from a treaty country, you may remain in your home country's social security system (exempt from Irish PRSI) for a limited period (typically 24 months, extendable).

### 10.2 Double Taxation Treaties

Ireland has extensive double taxation treaties. Foreign tax credits are available for taxes paid in other countries on income also taxed in Ireland.

### 10.3 Pension Contributions

Irish employees can make tax-deductible pension contributions up to age-related limits:

| Age | Max % of Earnings |
|-----|-------------------|
| Under 30 | 15% |
| 30-39 | 20% |
| 40-49 | 25% |
| 50-54 | 30% |
| 55-59 | 35% |
| 60+ | 40% |

**Earnings cap:** €115,000 (for tax relief purposes, 2025)

### 10.4 Remote Work Relief

Ireland introduced a remote working relief allowing employees to claim up to €3.20 per day (max 15 days/month = €768/year in 2025) for working from home without employer reimbursement.

### 10.5 Minimum Wage (2025)

National minimum wage increased to **€13.10 per hour** effective January 1, 2025 (up from €12.70 in 2024).

### 12.1 Base Configuration (2025)

**Required inputs:**
- `gross_annual`: Annual gross salary (required)
- `filing_status`: Single or Married (affects tax credits and bands)
- `age`: For USC reduced rate determination (age 70+ threshold)
- `has_medical_card`: For USC reduced rate eligibility

**Optional inputs:**
- `pension_contribution_percent`: For pension contribution deductions (affects taxable income)

### 12.2 Calculation Nodes Structure

Suggested calculation flow:
1. `taxable_income` = gross_annual - pension_contributions
2. `income_tax_before_credits` = bracket_tax(taxable_income, income_tax_brackets)
3. `personal_credit` = lookup based on filing_status
4. `employee_credit` = conditional based on gross_annual (min €10k, max €2k)
5. `total_credits` = sum of all credits
6. `income_tax` = max(0, income_tax_before_credits - total_credits)
7. `usc` = bracket_tax(gross_annual, usc_brackets) with reduced_rate conditional
8. `prsi` = percent_of(gross_annual, 4.2%) with €352/week minimum threshold
9. `net_annual` = gross_annual - income_tax - usc - prsi

### 12.3 SARP Variant Configuration

Create variant: `configs/ie/2025/variants/sarp.yaml`

**Additional variant inputs:**
- None (eligibility checked via gross_annual >= 100,000)

**Variant calculation modifications:**
- Add `sarp_relief` node: 30% of (gross_annual - 100,000), capped at 900,000 relief amount
- Modify `taxable_income`: gross_annual - sarp_relief - pension_contributions
- USC and PRSI calculations unchanged (apply to full gross_annual)

### 12.4 Test Vectors Needed

**Base configuration test cases:**
- Low income: €20,000 (below tax credit threshold)
- Median income: €45,000
- High income: €80,000 (USC 8% bracket)
- Reduced USC: €40,000 with age 70+ or medical card
- Married joint: €80,000 with both working (extended standard rate band)

**SARP variant test cases:**
- Minimum SARP: €100,000 (no relief, at threshold)
- Standard SARP: €150,000
- High SARP: €500,000
- Cap test: €1,200,000 (verify €1M cap)

### 12.5 Breakdowns and Categories

**Category mapping:**
- `income_tax`: "income_tax"
- `usc`: "contribution" (it's technically a tax but functions like a social charge)
- `prsi`: "contribution"
- `personal_credit`: "credit"
- `employee_credit`: "credit"
- `sarp_relief`: "deduction" (for SARP variant)

### 12.6 Data Sources for Annual Updates

Monitor these sources for changes:
1. Irish Budget announcements (usually October each year)
2. Revenue.ie updates to tax relief charts
3. Department of Social Protection PRSI rate updates
4. SARP program extension announcements

**Note:** SARP program scheduled to end 2025 - verify extension before implementing 2026 config.

## 13. Key Gotchas and Traps

### 13.1 PRSI Mid-Year Rate Change

The PRSI rate changes mid-year (October 1) in 2025 and 2026. For simplicity in the calculator:
- Use the October 1+ rate (4.2% for 2025) as the primary rate
- Document the simplification in notices
- Alternative: Implement month-by-month calculation with blended rate

### 13.2 USC Applies to Full Income Under SARP

Common misconception: People think SARP reduces USC. It doesn't.
- SARP relief reduces only income tax calculation base
- USC and PRSI apply to full gross income
- Make this clear in SARP variant description

### 13.3 Employee Credit Taper

The employee credit has a minimum income requirement (€10,000) AND a taper for lower incomes:
- Income < €10,000: Credit = 20% of income
- Income >= €10,000: Full €2,000 credit

### 13.4 280-Day Look-Back Rule

For expats: The 280-day rule can catch people who think they're non-resident in Year 2 because they spent fewer than 183 days in Ireland that year.

### 13.5 Split-Year Employment Income Only

Split-year treatment applies only to employment income, not investment income or other sources. This is more restrictive than UK split-year rules.

### 13.6 SARP €100,000 is Basic Salary Only

The €100,000 threshold is based on basic salary, excluding:
- Bonuses
- Commissions
- Share-based remuneration
- Benefits in kind

Total package may be higher, but basic must be €100k+.

### 13.7 Married Person Increased Band is Non-Transferable

The €35,000 increase to the standard rate band for married couples (when both work) is limited to the lower earner's income and is non-transferable between spouses.

Example: If one spouse earns €100k and the other €20k, the standard rate band is only €53k + €20k = €73k (not €88k).
