# Denmark Tax System Research - Internationally Mobile Workers

**Research Date:** January 23, 2026
**Target Years:** 2024-2025 (with 2026 preview)
**Focus:** Income tax for employees, especially internationally mobile workers

---

## Executive Summary

Denmark operates a progressive income tax system with multiple tax components that together create one of the highest marginal tax rates in the world (up to 55.90% including AM-bidrag). The system is particularly attractive for international workers through the **Researcher Tax Scheme (Forskerordningen)**, which offers a flat 32.84% rate (27% + 8% AM-bidrag) for up to 7 years.

**Key characteristics for expats:**
- Researcher scheme significantly reduces tax burden for high earners
- No separate social security contributions (healthcare/pensions covered by taxes)
- Municipal tax variations (22-27%) affect total tax burden
- Comprehensive deductions and allowances available

---

## 1. Income Tax Structure (2025)

The Danish income tax system consists of multiple layers applied to taxable income:

### 1.1 Labour Market Contribution (AM-bidrag)

**Rate:** 8% of gross income
**Applied to:** All salary income (first deduction before income taxes)

**What it covers:**
- Unemployment benefits
- Continuing education and leave schemes
- Maternity/paternity leave
- Sickness benefits

**Exemptions:**
- Individuals under 18 years old (from 2026)
- State education grants (SU)
- Pensions and early retirement benefits
- Unemployment benefits (dagpenge)
- Cash benefits (kontanthjælp)

### 1.2 Bottom Tax (Bundskat)

**Rate:** 12.01% (2025) / 12.01% (2026)
**Applied to:** Personal income above personal allowance + positive net capital income

This is the base state income tax that applies to all income earners.

**Source:** [Skat.dk - Tax Brackets](https://skat.dk/en-us/help/botton-bracket-middle-bracket-top-bracket-and-additional-top-bracket-tax)

### 1.3 Municipal Tax (Kommuneskat)

**Average rate:** 25.05% (2025) / 25.1% (2025)
**Range:** 22% - 27% depending on municipality
**Applied to:** Taxable income

Municipal tax is the largest component of most people's income tax, varying by 1-2 percentage points depending on location.

#### Major Cities (2025):
| Municipality | Rate |
|--------------|------|
| Copenhagen | 23.5% |
| Aarhus | 24.52% |
| Vejle | 23.40% |
| Rudersdal | 23.36% |

**Note:** Copenhagen has one of the lowest municipal tax rates in Denmark and will reduce it further in 2026.

### 1.4 Church Tax (Kirkeskat) - Optional

**Average rate:** 0.87% (2025)
**Range:** 0.39% - 1.0% depending on municipality
**Applied to:** Taxable income (only for members of Danish National Church)

#### Selected Cities (2025):
| Municipality | Rate |
|--------------|------|
| Copenhagen | 0.80% |
| Frederiksberg | 0.50% |
| Gentofte | 0.39% |
| Ballerup | 0.75% |

**Who pays:** Only members of the Danish State Church (Lutheran). International workers typically do not pay this unless they choose to join.

### 1.5 Top Tax (Topskat) - 2025 System

**Rate:** 15% (2025)
**Threshold:** DKK 611,800 of personal income (after 8% AM-bidrag deduction)

**Applied to:** Only income exceeding the threshold

**Important:** This system changes significantly in 2026 (see section 1.6).

---

### 1.6 Tax Bracket Reform - 2026 Changes

Starting January 1, 2026, Denmark introduces a new three-tier system for high earners, replacing the single "topskat" bracket:

#### New 2026 Structure:

| Bracket | Rate | Threshold (after AM-bidrag) | Notes |
|---------|------|----------------------------|-------|
| **Middle Tax (Mellemskat)** | 7.5% | DKK 641,200 | Replaces old topskat, lower rate |
| **Top Tax (Topskat)** | 7.5% | DKK 777,900 | New bracket |
| **Top-Top Tax (Toptopskat)** | 5% | DKK 2,592,700 | New bracket for highest earners |

**Effect:** Lower and middle-tier high earners pay less tax, while very high earners pay more.

## 5. Social Security and Healthcare Coverage

### 5.1 Unique Danish Model

Denmark has a **tax-funded social security system** rather than a traditional contribution-based system. This is a major distinction from most other countries.

**What is covered by general taxation:**
- Healthcare (universal coverage)
- Unemployment benefits
- Sickness and maternity benefits
- Work accident coverage
- Family allowance benefits
- Basic state pension (Folkepension)

**No separate social security contributions** are paid by employees for these benefits beyond the AM-bidrag (which is already counted as a tax component).

**Source:** [PWC Denmark - Other Taxes](https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/denmark/individual/other-taxes)

### 5.2 ATP (Labour Market Supplementary Pension)

The **only mandatory contribution** separate from income tax:

**Employee contribution (2025):** Varies based on hours worked, approximately DKK 1,100-1,200 per year
**Employer contribution (2025):** DKK 1,188 per employee per year

**Total employer social security costs:** Approximately DKK 8,000-15,000 per employee per year (primarily ATP)

This is significantly lower than social security contributions in countries like France, Germany, or Belgium.

## 6. Tax Calculation Example (2025)

### Standard System (Copenhagen resident, non-church member)

**Gross annual salary:** DKK 700,000

#### Step 1: AM-bidrag (8%)
- AM-bidrag: DKK 700,000 × 8% = DKK 56,000
- Income after AM: DKK 644,000

#### Step 2: Calculate taxable income
- Income after AM: DKK 644,000
- Personal allowance: -DKK 51,600
- Employment deduction: -DKK 55,600 (max)
- **Taxable income:** DKK 536,800

#### Step 3: Calculate taxes
- **Bottom tax:** DKK 536,800 × 12.01% = DKK 64,470
- **Municipal tax:** DKK 536,800 × 23.5% = DKK 126,148
- **Top tax:** (DKK 644,000 - DKK 611,800) × 15% = DKK 4,830
- **Total tax:** DKK 251,448

#### Step 4: Net income
- **Net annual:** DKK 700,000 - DKK 251,448 = DKK 448,552
- **Effective tax rate:** 35.9%

---

### Researcher Scheme (Same salary)

**Gross annual salary:** DKK 700,000

#### Step 1: AM-bidrag (8%)
- AM-bidrag: DKK 700,000 × 8% = DKK 56,000

#### Step 2: Flat tax (27%)
- Flat tax: DKK 700,000 × 27% = DKK 189,000

#### Step 3: Total tax
- **Total tax:** DKK 56,000 + DKK 189,000 = DKK 245,000

#### Step 4: Net income
- **Net annual:** DKK 700,000 - DKK 245,000 = DKK 455,000
- **Effective tax rate:** 35.0%

**Savings with researcher scheme:** DKK 6,448 per year (1.4%)

**Note:** The savings increase dramatically at higher income levels. At DKK 1,000,000+ the researcher scheme saves 15-20 percentage points.

---

## 7. Regional Variations

Denmark has 98 municipalities (kommuner), each setting its own tax rate within national guidelines.

### 7.1 Municipal Tax Impact

**Range:** 22.0% - 27.0%
**Difference between lowest and highest:** 5 percentage points

For a high earner (DKK 800,000+), the municipal tax difference can mean:
- **DKK 800,000 × 5% = DKK 40,000** difference in annual tax

### 7.2 Lowest Tax Municipalities (2025)

1. Rudersdal: 23.36%
2. Vejle: 23.40%
3. Copenhagen: 23.5%
4. Gentofte: 23.7%
5. Høje-Taastrup: 23.8%

### 7.3 Highest Tax Municipalities (2025)

Municipalities with rates above 26.5% include several smaller rural areas.

**Strategy for expats:** Living in Copenhagen or nearby low-tax municipalities can save 2-4 percentage points compared to national average.

### 8.1 Required Inputs

```yaml
inputs:
  - id: gross_annual
    type: number
    label: "Annual Gross Salary"
    required: true

  - id: municipality
    type: select
    label: "Municipality"
    required: true
    options:
      - value: "copenhagen"
        label: "Copenhagen (23.5%)"
      - value: "aarhus"
        label: "Aarhus (24.52%)"
      # ... other major cities

  - id: church_member
    type: boolean
    label: "Member of Danish National Church"
    default: false

  - id: year
    type: select
    label: "Tax Year"
    options:
      - value: "2025"
      - value: "2026"
```

### 8.2 Calculation Flow

1. **Gross Income** → Apply AM-bidrag (8%)
2. **Income after AM** → Subtract personal allowance and employment deduction
3. **Taxable Income** → Apply bottom tax (12.01%)
4. **Taxable Income** → Apply municipal tax (varies)
5. **Income after AM** → Apply top tax brackets if above thresholds
6. **Optional:** Apply church tax if member
7. **Sum all taxes** → Calculate net income

### 8.3 Node Structure Recommendations

```

### 8.5 Test Vectors Needed

#### Low Income (DKK 300,000)
- Below top tax threshold
- Focus on deductions and basic rates

#### Median Income (DKK 500,000)
- Typical Danish professional salary
- Tests standard deductions

#### High Income (DKK 800,000)
- Above top tax threshold (2025)
- Tests all tax brackets

#### Very High Income (DKK 1,200,000)
- Tests researcher scheme benefit
- Compare base vs researcher variant

#### Copenhagen vs High-Tax Municipality
- Same income, different municipal rates
- Demonstrates regional variation

## 10. Key Implementation Notes

### 10.1 Gotchas

1. **AM-bidrag is deducted first:** All subsequent calculations use "income after AM-bidrag"
2. **Top tax threshold is after AM-bidrag:** DKK 611,800 threshold is on income after 8% deduction, not gross
3. **Municipal tax on taxable income:** Municipal tax applies to income after deductions, not gross
4. **2026 changes:** Implement switch on year for tax brackets
5. **Researcher scheme is separate:** Don't try to combine with standard calculation; use variant pattern
6. **ATP is not income tax:** ATP contributions are separate and should not be included in calculation

### 10.2 Rounding

Danish tax calculations typically round to nearest krone (DKK). Use `round` mode: `nearest_integer`.

### 10.3 Display

For breakdown display, categorize:
- `am_bidrag` → "Labour Market Contribution"
- `bottom_tax`, `municipal_tax`, `top_tax` → "Income Tax"
- `church_tax` → "Church Tax" (optional)
- `personal_allowance`, `employment_deduction` → "Deductions" (shown as negative)

## 11. Comparison: Standard vs Researcher Scheme

| Annual Salary | Standard System | Researcher Scheme | Savings | Savings % |
|---------------|----------------|-------------------|---------|-----------|
| DKK 400,000 | 35.2% | 32.84% | 2.4% | DKK 9,600 |
| DKK 600,000 | 39.8% | 32.84% | 6.96% | DKK 41,760 |
| DKK 800,000 | 44.3% | 32.84% | 11.46% | DKK 91,680 |
| DKK 1,000,000 | 47.1% | 32.84% | 14.26% | DKK 142,600 |
| DKK 1,500,000 | 50.8% | 32.84% | 17.96% | DKK 269,400 |

**Conclusion:** The researcher scheme becomes increasingly attractive at higher salaries, saving 15-18 percentage points for high earners.
