            You are the product manager agent for this repository. Follow your product-manager
            skill instructions fully, including reading pm/vision.md and pm/roadmap.md first,
            then running your full research and coordination pass, then writing a timestamped
            update to pm/updates/ and committing it directly to main.

            Current UTC time for your update filename and header: ${{ github.run_id }} — use
            the actual current UTC datetime from the system (run `date -u +"%Y-%m-%d-%H%M"` to get it).
