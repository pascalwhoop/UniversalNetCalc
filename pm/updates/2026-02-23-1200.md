# PM Run Log — 2026-02-23

## Summary

First PM agent run. Oriented on vision and roadmap. Completed full triage of open issues, synced
in-progress status with open PRs, and triggered developer on 3 high-priority issues.

---

## User Research Observations

**Issue patterns:**
- Large volume of 2026 tax config issues (56–74) — batch of country updates for the new fiscal year.
  These are well-structured and ready to be picked up sequentially.
- Three engine/tech-debt bugs (#51, #52, #53, #54) that were completely unlabeled — risk of being
  forgotten.
- Currency conversion is a recurring pain point appearing in two distinct forms:
  - #41: The exchange rate API itself is broken/stale
  - #102: Conversion not triggered on subsequent country switches in wizard
  These are related but separate bugs.
- UX issues (#37–#43) form a coherent cluster around the wizard + salary sync initiative — most
  are ready for dev.
- Issues #8, #9, #13, #14, #21 are old and mostly stale or superseded. Not triaged aggressively
  to avoid noise; #10 (mobile UI) and #11 (comparison summary bug) are still valid.

**Priority signal:**
- The 2026 country configs (p1 EU countries, p2 rest-of-world) are time-sensitive — some fiscal
  years start April 1 (JP, NZ) and July 1 (AU).
- Currency/wizard bugs (#102, #41) are active UX regressions affecting the core comparison flow.

  `status:in-review`. This is already merged into the `feat/2026-all-countries` branch.

## Developer Triggers (3/3)

1. **#102** — bug: currency not reconverted on subsequent country switch in wizard (p1)
2. **#51** — bug: base_amount accumulates incorrectly in evaluateBracketTax (p1)
3. **#103** — bug: left-aligned feature card + refactor to data-driven loop (p2, small/clear)

## Roadmap Notes

No changes to roadmap structure this run. Priorities remain:
- **Now:** Wizard/UX work (PR #91 in review), 2026 EU country configs
- **Next:** Currency fix (#41), cost of living module (#38), salary mode (#42)
- **Later:** Country-specific compensation fields (#47) — large epic, needs research doc first

The 2026 country config batch (56–74) should be worked through sequentially by priority:
p1 EU countries first (NL, DE, FR, SE, NO, DK, CH, ES, IE), then p2 (PT, CA, KR, US, SG),
then p3 (AU, NZ, UAE). JP (#71) is also p3 but has an April deadline — consider bumping to p2.
